../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_293.wav|225|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_016.wav|225|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_220.wav|225|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_150.wav|225|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_199.wav|225|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_366.wav|225|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_144.wav|225|She will do for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_002.wav|225|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_287.wav|225|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_308.wav|225|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_165.wav|225|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_353.wav|225|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_023.wav|225|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_090.wav|225|I did not have a bet on myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_059.wav|225|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_329.wav|225|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_084.wav|225|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_201.wav|225|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_037.wav|225|In fact, they are the future of investment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_347.wav|225|Boy is the town a mess.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_171.wav|225|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_257.wav|225|My son was too young to die.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_061.wav|225|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_127.wav|225|It is a common problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_239.wav|225|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_149.wav|225|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_133.wav|225|I think he's the favourite.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_305.wav|225|Cast Away now on general release.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_243.wav|225|The irony was not lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_218.wav|225|We used to live with dignity in our country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_324.wav|225|There is no plan B.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_054.wav|225|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_040.wav|225|You'd better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_089.wav|225|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_276.wav|225|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_330.wav|225|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_025.wav|225|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_355.wav|225|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_177.wav|225|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_082.wav|225|That view is held by many others within the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_156.wav|225|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_010.wav|225|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_295.wav|225|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_248.wav|225|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_281.wav|225|They were not at the property yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_004.wav|225|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_142.wav|225|Well, you can have a tree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_264.wav|225|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_052.wav|225|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_322.wav|225|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_114.wav|225|I told him I was a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_358.wav|225|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_028.wav|225|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_336.wav|225|I came into this world with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_046.wav|225|No details of the talks were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_192.wav|225|However, this idea is never developed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_317.wav|225|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_121.wav|225|You get a lot for your money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_298.wav|225|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_067.wav|225|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_073.wav|225|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_135.wav|225|We have seen a copy of the report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_303.wav|225|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_009.wav|225|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_235.wav|225|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_003.wav|225|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_145.wav|225|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_309.wav|225|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_286.wav|225|I wanted to change the formula.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_151.wav|225|Nothing has been put into action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_017.wav|225|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_221.wav|225|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_346.wav|225|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_200.wav|225|It looked like a river.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_036.wav|225|It was a close call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_022.wav|225|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_352.wav|225|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_328.wav|225|It is just a tax on employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_058.wav|225|However, the problem is the timing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_238.wav|225|Paterson can afford to be generous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_242.wav|225|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_310.wav|225|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_126.wav|225|The squad is too small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_060.wav|225|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_195.wav|225|It is hard to tell.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_331.wav|225|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_277.wav|225|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_169.wav|225|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_219.wav|225|They did not attack the themes of the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_325.wav|225|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_113.wav|225|The big issue for us is the review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_030.wav|225|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_176.wav|225|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_083.wav|225|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_268.wav|225|I realised I was lucky to have it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_118.wav|225|We suffered a lot for seven years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_354.wav|225|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_024.wav|225|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_212.wav|225|After that nothing could save him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_280.wav|225|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_143.wav|225|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_005.wav|225|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_011.wav|225|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_157.wav|225|He was asked to quit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_294.wav|225|However, we had no failures in our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_337.wav|225|But they have the sound.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_323.wav|225|It is a court case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_115.wav|225|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_265.wav|225|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_053.wav|225|I have made that offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_029.wav|225|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_359.wav|225|But we welcome this document.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_302.wav|225|Three hours later, the man was free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_072.wav|225|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_244.wav|225|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_008.wav|225|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_193.wav|225|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_299.wav|225|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_066.wav|225|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_316.wav|225|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_120.wav|225|The industry is not well organised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_351.wav|225|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_021.wav|225|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_092.wav|225|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_109.wav|225|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_279.wav|225|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_086.wav|225|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_203.wav|225|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_035.wav|225|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_173.wav|225|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_128.wav|225|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_258.wav|225|We were not allowed to go to help them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_291.wav|225|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_014.wav|225|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_222.wav|225|In each case they were a goal down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_152.wav|225|The weather forecast isn't good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_236.wav|225|That will be the criteria for the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_285.wav|225|We have to break that cycle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_326.wav|225|He will go a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_110.wav|225|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_056.wav|225|Clearly, it can go either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_274.wav|225|We have not reached the point of no return.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_104.wav|225|His is a success story by any standard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_332.wav|225|It's difficult to predict the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_348.wav|225|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_038.wav|225|Diving is no part of football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_063.wav|225|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_196.wav|225|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_019.wav|225|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_182.wav|225|We are just glad to be alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_131.wav|225|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_241.wav|225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_012.wav|225|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_224.wav|225|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_297.wav|225|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_318.wav|225|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_006.wav|225|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_094.wav|225|That's as it should be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_027.wav|225|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_211.wav|225|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_357.wav|225|It is a sign of hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_175.wav|225|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_033.wav|225|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_049.wav|225|I have learned from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_159.wav|225|Neither side can win this war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_315.wav|225|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_123.wav|225|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_253.wav|225|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_065.wav|225|There is no pressure on us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_071.wav|225|He is in the queue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_301.wav|225|I must do something about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_266.wav|225|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_320.wav|225|We have a good healthy debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_116.wav|225|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_208.wav|225|You are a great player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_334.wav|225|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_044.wav|225|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_108.wav|225|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_172.wav|225|Nobody did in those days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_202.wav|225|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_020.wav|225|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_166.wav|225|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_350.wav|225|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_237.wav|225|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_001.wav|225|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_147.wav|225|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_290.wav|225|Scotch beef is badly missed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_153.wav|225|We have a clean bill of health.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_365.wav|225|You did not see it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_223.wav|225|The police have an awful lot to explain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_275.wav|225|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_039.wav|225|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_349.wav|225|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_057.wav|225|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_111.wav|225|It isn't a happy memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_289.wav|225|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_240.wav|225|We are in the hat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_312.wav|225|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_124.wav|225|As for the warning, it was not needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_254.wav|225|The problem was a social problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_062.wav|225|I was very pleased with them today, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_018.wav|225|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_197.wav|225|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_282.wav|225|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_141.wav|225|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_007.wav|225|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_013.wav|225|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_225.wav|225|It is good for our team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_363.wav|225|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_319.wav|225|There's still a bit to go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_296.wav|225|It goes back a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_174.wav|225|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_081.wav|225|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_356.wav|225|I said he was set to retire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_026.wav|225|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_210.wav|225|Scotland will play its part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_136.wav|225|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_300.wav|225|I can hardly believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_070.wav|225|That is bound to happen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_191.wav|225|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_158.wav|225|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_064.wav|225|It could take some time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_314.wav|225|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_122.wav|225|I didn't feel under any pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_179.wav|225|They know no other way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_045.wav|225|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_273.wav|225|He has not created a Festival resource.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_103.wav|225|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_335.wav|225|We are in the end game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_117.wav|225|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p225/p225_051.wav|225|We are committed to the ban.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_028.wav|226|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_358.wav|226|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_322.wav|226|Referees are easy targets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_114.wav|226|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_264.wav|226|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_052.wav|226|It is the whole package.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_046.wav|226|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_270.wav|226|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_100.wav|226|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_336.wav|226|It is a time bomb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_298.wav|226|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_251.wav|226|There's the mix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_067.wav|226|It's a matter of balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_317.wav|226|It's about my time as a guitarist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_121.wav|226|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_192.wav|226|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_009.wav|226|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_186.wav|226|It just came into my head that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_135.wav|226|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_303.wav|226|One was a lawyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_073.wav|226|The script was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_245.wav|226|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_163.wav|226|I've learned from my mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_355.wav|226|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_025.wav|226|He has not been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_213.wav|226|Feel the heat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_096.wav|226|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_269.wav|226|They are never here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_119.wav|226|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_082.wav|226|It is a terrible place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_207.wav|226|It's a mixture of everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_031.wav|226|This is the window.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_341.wav|226|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_177.wav|226|I took the gun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_295.wav|226|He should have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_010.wav|226|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_226.wav|226|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_156.wav|226|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_360.wav|226|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_142.wav|226|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_232.wav|226|My wife and family are the support system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_004.wav|226|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_248.wav|226|I was shocked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_281.wav|226|It happens from time to time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_138.wav|226|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_194.wav|226|It is a case of taking a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_311.wav|226|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_127.wav|226|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_257.wav|226|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_061.wav|226|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_075.wav|226|Painful, but only because it's true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_243.wav|226|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_133.wav|226|She really suffered for her art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_305.wav|226|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_180.wav|226|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_149.wav|226|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_239.wav|226|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_262.wav|226|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_054.wav|226|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_324.wav|226|We are in the end game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_112.wav|226|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_168.wav|226|It is too much for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_218.wav|226|I was so nervous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_106.wav|226|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_330.wav|226|The weekly average was three hours.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_040.wav|226|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_089.wav|226|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_276.wav|226|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_150.wav|226|We just had a go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_199.wav|226|We live by the rule of law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_366.wav|226|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_016.wav|226|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_220.wav|226|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_293.wav|226|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_308.wav|226|This is a war over our home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_287.wav|226|Who will perform?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_078.wav|226|There could be a way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_234.wav|226|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_002.wav|226|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_144.wav|226|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_329.wav|226|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_090.wav|226|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_059.wav|226|She's a spy!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_023.wav|226|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_215.wav|226|I am delighted for Simon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_165.wav|226|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_353.wav|226|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_347.wav|226|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_171.wav|226|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_201.wav|226|The service from the other players was super.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_037.wav|226|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_084.wav|226|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_101.wav|226|It was mayhem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_337.wav|226|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_047.wav|226|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_271.wav|226|He was popular.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_359.wav|226|He's very explosive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_029.wav|226|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_265.wav|226|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_053.wav|226|He had no enemies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_323.wav|226|He said she was mad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_115.wav|226|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_187.wav|226|I had a train to catch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_008.wav|226|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_072.wav|226|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_244.wav|226|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_134.wav|226|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_302.wav|226|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_316.wav|226|The whole region is in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_120.wav|226|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_299.wav|226|There was no hint of scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_066.wav|226|Art is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_193.wav|226|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_083.wav|226|It works for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_340.wav|226|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_176.wav|226|If that's the case, he will struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_206.wav|226|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_030.wav|226|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_024.wav|226|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_212.wav|226|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_162.wav|226|It is an attitude of mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_354.wav|226|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_118.wav|226|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_097.wav|226|We could not get any possession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_268.wav|226|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_233.wav|226|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_005.wav|226|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_143.wav|226|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_139.wav|226|I am now unemployed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_249.wav|226|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_280.wav|226|He has a wealth of experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_294.wav|226|The results are sometimes contentious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_157.wav|226|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_361.wav|226|Our numbers are small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_011.wav|226|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_227.wav|226|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_132.wav|226|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_304.wav|226|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_074.wav|226|You need a trademark.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_242.wav|226|It's only fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_238.wav|226|Hospitals are for the ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_181.wav|226|I've been there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_148.wav|226|Three penalties were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_195.wav|226|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_256.wav|226|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_060.wav|226|It is unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_310.wav|226|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_126.wav|226|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_041.wav|226|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_088.wav|226|Detection is often difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_107.wav|226|It was a good performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_331.wav|226|Donald was his friend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_325.wav|226|I am very happy to be here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_113.wav|226|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_263.wav|226|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_055.wav|226|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_219.wav|226|I might come back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_169.wav|226|Nobody did in those days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_286.wav|226|Yet, it worked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_079.wav|226|Neither it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_309.wav|226|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_145.wav|226|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_235.wav|226|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_003.wav|226|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_017.wav|226|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_221.wav|226|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_151.wav|226|We have seen a copy of the report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_198.wav|226|Is that it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_367.wav|226|Equity declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_292.wav|226|It goes back a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_200.wav|226|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_036.wav|226|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_346.wav|226|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_085.wav|226|It can be halted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_091.wav|226|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_058.wav|226|Next league matches Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_328.wav|226|That's the law of the land.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_164.wav|226|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_352.wav|226|His contract was then not renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_022.wav|226|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_214.wav|226|I'm pleased about one thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_253.wav|226|I was never going to play against Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_065.wav|226|You do not change overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_315.wav|226|It was a question of patience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_190.wav|226|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_159.wav|226|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_229.wav|226|I'd never seen a play about me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_184.wav|226|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_137.wav|226|It will be too hot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_301.wav|226|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_071.wav|226|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_247.wav|226|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_320.wav|226|The home team had an amazing start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_116.wav|226|It is normal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_266.wav|226|The warning is timely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_050.wav|226|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_099.wav|226|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_044.wav|226|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_272.wav|226|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_102.wav|226|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_334.wav|226|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_178.wav|226|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_208.wav|226|I don't want to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_318.wav|226|Kids are terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_068.wav|226|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_297.wav|226|There's a pause.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_012.wav|226|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_224.wav|226|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_154.wav|226|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_362.wav|226|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_140.wav|226|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_189.wav|226|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_230.wav|226|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_006.wav|226|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_283.wav|226|He looked very sharp.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_161.wav|226|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_357.wav|226|I kept going for her.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_027.wav|226|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_211.wav|226|But I am a worried man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_094.wav|226|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_339.wav|226|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_080.wav|226|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_049.wav|226|But it might have done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_205.wav|226|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_033.wav|226|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_343.wav|226|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_175.wav|226|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_260.wav|226|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_056.wav|226|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_326.wav|226|The airport was even different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_110.wav|226|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_348.wav|226|Look at the witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_104.wav|226|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_332.wav|226|I am so upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_042.wav|226|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_274.wav|226|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_019.wav|226|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_369.wav|226|He took over our lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_313.wav|226|The minister is the engineer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_125.wav|226|She's got to say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_255.wav|226|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_063.wav|226|It's a real challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_077.wav|226|Tommy is not a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_288.wav|226|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_241.wav|226|They are all bright and different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_131.wav|226|I was furious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_307.wav|226|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_092.wav|226|It's just awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_021.wav|226|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_217.wav|226|It's not ideal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_167.wav|226|They will do their own thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_351.wav|226|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_345.wav|226|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_173.wav|226|His team management was protective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_203.wav|226|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_279.wav|226|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_086.wav|226|This is the way things should be handled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_109.wav|226|Oil embargo endorsed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_152.wav|226|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_364.wav|226|This is a club on the rise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_014.wav|226|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_258.wav|226|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_291.wav|226|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_128.wav|226|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_285.wav|226|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_236.wav|226|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_370.wav|226|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_146.wav|226|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_185.wav|226|It is not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_070.wav|226|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_246.wav|226|His body was never found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_136.wav|226|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_300.wav|226|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_314.wav|226|I did not name it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_122.wav|226|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_252.wav|226|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_064.wav|226|It is not great art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_228.wav|226|I am immensely sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_191.wav|226|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_158.wav|226|We will turn the corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_103.wav|226|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_335.wav|226|The boat was fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_045.wav|226|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_273.wav|226|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_209.wav|226|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_179.wav|226|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_267.wav|226|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_051.wav|226|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_098.wav|226|If you could find it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_321.wav|226|My body is clearly capable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_117.wav|226|I don't have many friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_231.wav|226|The track is currently covered in snow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_007.wav|226|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_141.wav|226|Our intentions are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_188.wav|226|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_069.wav|226|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_296.wav|226|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_319.wav|226|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_155.wav|226|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_363.wav|226|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_013.wav|226|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_225.wav|226|A career as a doctor is on hold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_048.wav|226|It's a blessing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_338.wav|226|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_342.wav|226|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_174.wav|226|It's quite a routine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_204.wav|226|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_032.wav|226|I was an athlete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_026.wav|226|That's no bad thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_210.wav|226|It's like a garage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_160.wav|226|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_356.wav|226|She is free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_095.wav|226|That will come after the game on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_349.wav|226|He's been the key to everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_039.wav|226|It has failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_043.wav|226|Is there a new way forward?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_105.wav|226|May not have been at fault?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_333.wav|226|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_327.wav|226|We do the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_111.wav|226|It was an adventure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_261.wav|226|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_057.wav|226|It's the big omission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_130.wav|226|I thought it was a fantastic game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_306.wav|226|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_076.wav|226|Help is needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_289.wav|226|This is a national crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_240.wav|226|She is well balanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_183.wav|226|I have no sympathy with her at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_368.wav|226|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_197.wav|226|There was no option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_018.wav|226|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_254.wav|226|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_062.wav|226|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_312.wav|226|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_124.wav|226|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_202.wav|226|They are in the euro.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_034.wav|226|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_344.wav|226|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_172.wav|226|It became a book by itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_108.wav|226|That time is not now, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_278.wav|226|I feel pretty good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_093.wav|226|It's never too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_166.wav|226|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_350.wav|226|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_020.wav|226|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_216.wav|226|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_284.wav|226|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_237.wav|226|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_001.wav|226|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_015.wav|226|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_223.wav|226|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_153.wav|226|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_365.wav|226|I have got a wife to feed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_129.wav|226|She has been shot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_259.wav|226|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p226/p226_290.wav|226|Scotland were beaten again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_312.wav|227|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_124.wav|227|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_254.wav|227|It is a court case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_062.wav|227|They have to come up with a solution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_018.wav|227|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_368.wav|227|A crucial moment has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_197.wav|227|The force is with them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_183.wav|227|I have spoken to head office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_076.wav|227|There may be reasons for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_289.wav|227|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_240.wav|227|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_130.wav|227|He is a great addition to our team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_306.wav|227|It is an amazing response.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_394.wav|227|I wanted to go out on a high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_261.wav|227|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_057.wav|227|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_327.wav|227|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_111.wav|227|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_105.wav|227|Such actions are rarely popular.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_333.wav|227|It is so easy to be negative.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_043.wav|227|I'd come back from London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_275.wav|227|This is no reflection on Rangers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_039.wav|227|Among them are many criminals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_349.wav|227|I came into this world with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_380.wav|227|We are still getting over it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_259.wav|227|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_290.wav|227|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_129.wav|227|And I have some advice for my old friend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_153.wav|227|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_365.wav|227|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_015.wav|227|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_223.wav|227|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_237.wav|227|We can certainly build on this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_001.wav|227|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_371.wav|227|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_147.wav|227|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_284.wav|227|There's not much money in cycling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_020.wav|227|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_216.wav|227|You have caught a serial killer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_166.wav|227|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_399.wav|227|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_350.wav|227|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_093.wav|227|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_278.wav|227|That could be in place by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_087.wav|227|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_108.wav|227|It is much as it has been described.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_344.wav|227|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_172.wav|227|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_034.wav|227|President Bush is at war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_321.wav|227|I have got a victim.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_117.wav|227|This should begin in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_267.wav|227|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_051.wav|227|The motive for the shooting was not known.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_098.wav|227|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_392.wav|227|That's not like us at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_179.wav|227|It makes no influence on the public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_386.wav|227|I do not like to lose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_209.wav|227|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_045.wav|227|He was a home referee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_273.wav|227|No production contract is yet in sight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_103.wav|227|It was never a starter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_335.wav|227|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_191.wav|227|You know the sort of thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_158.wav|227|It is difficult to say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_228.wav|227|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_252.wav|227|The irony was not lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_064.wav|227|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_314.wav|227|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_122.wav|227|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_136.wav|227|This is a limited market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_300.wav|227|Stephen will get his first cap.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_070.wav|227|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_246.wav|227|She died in middle age.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_095.wav|227|You are like an animal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_160.wav|227|Seven people were later detained by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_356.wav|227|They were the acts of men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_026.wav|227|Movement has to take place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_210.wav|227|This is a holy place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_204.wav|227|This will be our new beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_032.wav|227|There, you were just a body.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_342.wav|227|Have a look at this lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_174.wav|227|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_338.wav|227|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_081.wav|227|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_048.wav|227|We have to look beyond the very short term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_013.wav|227|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_155.wav|227|It was a funny feeling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_363.wav|227|We are encouraged by the news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_319.wav|227|We have a clean bill of health.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_069.wav|227|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_296.wav|227|My body is a wreck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_282.wav|227|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_377.wav|227|It was forced to divert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_141.wav|227|He's not a Celtic man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_188.wav|227|We've just had it confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_231.wav|227|And the World Cup has not even begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_131.wav|227|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_307.wav|227|Size is not the issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_077.wav|227|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_288.wav|227|You get a lot for your money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_241.wav|227|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_255.wav|227|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_063.wav|227|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_313.wav|227|It could well be military.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_125.wav|227|You've got to be vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_369.wav|227|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_196.wav|227|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_019.wav|227|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_042.wav|227|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_274.wav|227|The capital costs are modest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_104.wav|227|And the match was not too bad, either.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_332.wav|227|I would do away with the dress code.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_348.wav|227|In the old days, it was easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_038.wav|227|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_395.wav|227|I felt the head was very like me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_326.wav|227|The dealer is on notice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_110.wav|227|That admission is not surprising.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_260.wav|227|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_056.wav|227|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_370.wav|227|We need to be prepared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_146.wav|227|Like the others, he was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_236.wav|227|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_285.wav|227|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_128.wav|227|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_402.wav|227|Persuaded to change his mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_258.wav|227|Nato was not a love affair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_291.wav|227|It was an easy decision to come here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_014.wav|227|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_222.wav|227|They have known the hard times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_152.wav|227|She had gone to the Catholic school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_364.wav|227|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_109.wav|227|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_279.wav|227|On the contrary they stand to gain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_086.wav|227|This is a complex and detailed report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_203.wav|227|It was served by sheriff officers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_035.wav|227|I became a widow overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_345.wav|227|The king is delighted by the honour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_173.wav|227|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_167.wav|227|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_398.wav|227|I can hardly believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_351.wav|227|There will have to be a full inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_021.wav|227|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_217.wav|227|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_092.wav|227|For once, you should believe the hype.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_208.wav|227|However, it is not as simple as this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_178.wav|227|I'm just going to hit the shot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_387.wav|227|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_102.wav|227|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_334.wav|227|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_044.wav|227|If I was a woman.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_272.wav|227|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_266.wav|227|Was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_050.wav|227|That is very hard, alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_099.wav|227|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_320.wav|227|In that case, the children were not missing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_116.wav|227|It is just a tax on employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_393.wav|227|You have to rely on each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_071.wav|227|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_247.wav|227|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_137.wav|227|Our position is quite simple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_301.wav|227|It's hard to see it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_184.wav|227|Well, you can have a tree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_229.wav|227|It's just a normal life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_190.wav|227|This is the time to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_159.wav|227|He was in great spirits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_315.wav|227|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_123.wav|227|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_253.wav|227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_065.wav|227|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_343.wav|227|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_175.wav|227|The jury is still out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_205.wav|227|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_033.wav|227|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_080.wav|227|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_049.wav|227|I expect a rapid response.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_339.wav|227|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_094.wav|227|Their attitude is all wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_027.wav|227|I feel I did not have enough time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_211.wav|227|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_161.wav|227|They want to see him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_357.wav|227|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_283.wav|227|Every one is a winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_230.wav|227|He must get to know himself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_006.wav|227|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_376.wav|227|Italy was just behind the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_140.wav|227|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_189.wav|227|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_154.wav|227|The strong pound also took its toll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_012.wav|227|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_068.wav|227|He had been a singer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_297.wav|227|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_318.wav|227|The weather forecast isn't good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_396.wav|227|It is a terrible equation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_169.wav|227|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_219.wav|227|They make a selective perception process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_263.wav|227|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_055.wav|227|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_113.wav|227|However, we have to be cautious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_107.wav|227|Then came the farewell to Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_331.wav|227|I'm not worried about the critics.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_041.wav|227|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_088.wav|227|We will deal with the refugees.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_277.wav|227|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_382.wav|227|This will impact on us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_310.wav|227|We are not increasing the number.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_126.wav|227|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_256.wav|227|She took them for a term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_060.wav|227|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_195.wav|227|I'm interested in interesting work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_181.wav|227|I think it's a good sign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_148.wav|227|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_238.wav|227|William Hague delighted his party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_074.wav|227|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_242.wav|227|I can't wait to meet him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_132.wav|227|I felt he was excellent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_304.wav|227|The partnership was set up during the summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_022.wav|227|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_214.wav|227|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_164.wav|227|There is no signature on this document.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_352.wav|227|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_328.wav|227|The party lasted all night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_091.wav|227|That is the important thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_058.wav|227|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_085.wav|227|The latter is due to be finished in February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_170.wav|227|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_200.wav|227|I guess I was lucky, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_036.wav|227|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_292.wav|227|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_401.wav|227|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_151.wav|227|I was shaking on the blocks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_198.wav|227|If the director is with you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_367.wav|227|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_017.wav|227|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_235.wav|227|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_003.wav|227|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_373.wav|227|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_145.wav|227|These men are a part of India.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_309.wav|227|We have the easy part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_286.wav|227|Not many companies can say that these days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_079.wav|227|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_193.wav|227|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_299.wav|227|She failed in her action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_250.wav|227|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_066.wav|227|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_316.wav|227|This is a big step up.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_120.wav|227|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_134.wav|227|It is a vicious circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_302.wav|227|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_072.wav|227|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_244.wav|227|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_008.wav|227|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_187.wav|227|He is believed to live in Britain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_378.wav|227|Alex Ferguson is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_323.wav|227|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_265.wav|227|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_053.wav|227|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_029.wav|227|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_359.wav|227|I am very interested in the subject.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_390.wav|227|Celtic were pleased to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_384.wav|227|He is in the queue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_047.wav|227|The casting of her husband was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_271.wav|227|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_101.wav|227|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_337.wav|227|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_011.wav|227|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_227.wav|227|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_157.wav|227|Adams is surely worth a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_361.wav|227|A report is expected next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_294.wav|227|But the plot is not the point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_249.wav|227|It is possible to be too good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_280.wav|227|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_139.wav|227|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_375.wav|227|It is a stroke of genius.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_143.wav|227|So I got a blood test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_233.wav|227|The fight is under way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_005.wav|227|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_097.wav|227|The following are the principal provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_268.wav|227|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_118.wav|227|My life has changed a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_162.wav|227|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_354.wav|227|Whether this return was too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_024.wav|227|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_212.wav|227|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_206.wav|227|My heart is with the artist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_030.wav|227|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_389.wav|227|In due course the deal was done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_340.wav|227|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_176.wav|227|But he has a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_083.wav|227|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_040.wav|227|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_089.wav|227|You might not make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_276.wav|227|I told you I was ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_106.wav|227|It is safe in our hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_330.wav|227|There's still a bit to go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_383.wav|227|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_218.wav|227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_397.wav|227|They have not got anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_168.wav|227|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_324.wav|227|McNaughton was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_112.wav|227|It has removed a bit of guilt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_262.wav|227|Our decision making was poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_054.wav|227|I could not do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_239.wav|227|There is a world of difference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_180.wav|227|That will apply to both sets of fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_149.wav|227|That was the difference between the sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_133.wav|227|They could use a boost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_305.wav|227|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_075.wav|227|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_243.wav|227|My wife and family are the support system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_257.wav|227|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_061.wav|227|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_311.wav|227|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_127.wav|227|Any success would have been an improvement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_194.wav|227|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_084.wav|227|Potions said he would drive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_201.wav|227|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_037.wav|227|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_347.wav|227|I've got a sense of humour, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_171.wav|227|The people are the hero.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_165.wav|227|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_353.wav|227|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_023.wav|227|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_215.wav|227|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_090.wav|227|It is open season on the Old Firm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_059.wav|227|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_329.wav|227|He would help me with the form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_372.wav|227|His views are hardly surprising.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_144.wav|227|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_002.wav|227|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_287.wav|227|They can leave at any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_078.wav|227|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_308.wav|227|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_400.wav|227|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_293.wav|227|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_016.wav|227|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_220.wav|227|There is no quick fix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_150.wav|227|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_199.wav|227|He made no order on costs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_366.wav|227|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_073.wav|227|It is a terrible place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_245.wav|227|It is the voice of the survivors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_135.wav|227|We could easily have lost that game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_303.wav|227|We have to be very, very careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_186.wav|227|They bought the property four years ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_379.wav|227|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_009.wav|227|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_192.wav|227|They were seriously after him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_317.wav|227|It goes back a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_121.wav|227|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_298.wav|227|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_251.wav|227|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_067.wav|227|I have proved that in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_385.wav|227|The salary changes are long overdue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_100.wav|227|I had a fortunate war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_336.wav|227|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_046.wav|227|There was no safety net.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_270.wav|227|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_264.wav|227|The baby deserves the credit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_052.wav|227|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_322.wav|227|The judge was really nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_114.wav|227|But we could only help a handful of people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_358.wav|227|Of course, we want to go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_391.wav|227|They will fight for everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_028.wav|227|We will look into it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_138.wav|227|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_248.wav|227|You will have seen the adverts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_281.wav|227|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_232.wav|227|He remains a main board director of Royal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_004.wav|227|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_374.wav|227|It has been made to entertain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_142.wav|227|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_156.wav|227|I'd love to be like Peter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_360.wav|227|He is not very big, either.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_010.wav|227|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_226.wav|227|I'm just a regular person.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_295.wav|227|It was never a free kick.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_388.wav|227|There is no deal as yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_341.wav|227|I am not obsessed with sex.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_177.wav|227|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_207.wav|227|That might mean another delay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_031.wav|227|The Premier League has been a huge success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_082.wav|227|We have to offer value for money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_119.wav|227|We did what we had to do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_096.wav|227|No, the equipment is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_269.wav|227|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_025.wav|227|Meetings will also remain private.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_213.wav|227|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_163.wav|227|Nobody did in those days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p227/p227_355.wav|227|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_079.wav|228|I had my suspicions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_286.wav|228|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_309.wav|228|He said she was mad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_145.wav|228|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_003.wav|228|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_235.wav|228|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_221.wav|228|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_367.wav|228|By that time, however, it was already too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_198.wav|228|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_151.wav|228|That should do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_292.wav|228|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_036.wav|228|The problem is the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_200.wav|228|I wanted to put myself on the line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_170.wav|228|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_346.wav|228|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_085.wav|228|But she might be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_058.wav|228|That's the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_091.wav|228|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_328.wav|228|It has moved on in the last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_352.wav|228|I expected these kind of questions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_164.wav|228|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_214.wav|228|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_022.wav|228|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_304.wav|228|It's not even finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_132.wav|228|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_242.wav|228|He says that he is no different from any other man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_074.wav|228|Painful, but only because it's true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_238.wav|228|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_148.wav|228|It is difficult for Ali.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_181.wav|228|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_195.wav|228|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_060.wav|228|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_256.wav|228|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_126.wav|228|Who would be a referee?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_310.wav|228|There was some merit in that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_277.wav|228|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_088.wav|228|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_041.wav|228|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_331.wav|228|He has to learn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_107.wav|228|It is a good day for the coalition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_113.wav|228|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_325.wav|228|The same things will happen with GM foods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_055.wav|228|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_263.wav|228|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_219.wav|228|She should not be blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_169.wav|228|Eight months later, he was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_083.wav|228|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_176.wav|228|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_340.wav|228|He's a genius.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_030.wav|228|Life was like a timetable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_206.wav|228|They are in the euro.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_212.wav|228|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_024.wav|228|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_354.wav|228|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_162.wav|228|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_118.wav|228|Further protests are likely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_268.wav|228|I was rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_097.wav|228|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_005.wav|228|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_233.wav|228|We are in the hat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_143.wav|228|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_139.wav|228|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_280.wav|228|We want to see the maximum of change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_249.wav|228|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_294.wav|228|They are wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_361.wav|228|He put some colour into Scottish history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_157.wav|228|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_227.wav|228|Clearly, the stakes are high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_011.wav|228|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_337.wav|228|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_101.wav|228|I love the Dome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_271.wav|228|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_047.wav|228|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_359.wav|228|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_029.wav|228|I feel I did not have enough time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_053.wav|228|Here's a clue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_265.wav|228|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_115.wav|228|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_323.wav|228|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_187.wav|228|They will run a mile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_008.wav|228|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_244.wav|228|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_072.wav|228|Try to save us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_302.wav|228|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_134.wav|228|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_120.wav|228|I don't want to use the term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_316.wav|228|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_066.wav|228|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_250.wav|228|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_299.wav|228|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_193.wav|228|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_366.wav|228|But I managed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_199.wav|228|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_150.wav|228|Had she enjoyed the experience?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_220.wav|228|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_016.wav|228|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_293.wav|228|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_308.wav|228|This film will be totally awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_078.wav|228|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_287.wav|228|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_002.wav|228|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_234.wav|228|We were a load of rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_144.wav|228|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_329.wav|228|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_059.wav|228|That is very hard, alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_090.wav|228|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_215.wav|228|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_023.wav|228|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_353.wav|228|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_165.wav|228|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_171.wav|228|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_347.wav|228|She is free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_037.wav|228|Indeed, he does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_084.wav|228|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_194.wav|228|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_127.wav|228|They've got to account for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_311.wav|228|I am very happy to be here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_061.wav|228|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_257.wav|228|Is that a serious question?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_243.wav|228|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_075.wav|228|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_305.wav|228|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_133.wav|228|This plan is an agenda for action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_149.wav|228|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_180.wav|228|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_239.wav|228|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_054.wav|228|It had been in place since last July.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_262.wav|228|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_112.wav|228|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_324.wav|228|There was no option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_168.wav|228|I've put my own money into this project.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_218.wav|228|That is an important part of our role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_330.wav|228|It is so unfair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_106.wav|228|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_276.wav|228|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_089.wav|228|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_040.wav|228|My whole life has changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_355.wav|228|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_163.wav|228|I was in daily contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_213.wav|228|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_025.wav|228|It's nice to hear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_269.wav|228|He's been here on numerous occasions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_096.wav|228|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_119.wav|228|It's in his blood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_082.wav|228|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_031.wav|228|He took me on a tour of the wards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_207.wav|228|Ferguson should take note.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_177.wav|228|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_341.wav|228|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_295.wav|228|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_226.wav|228|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_010.wav|228|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_360.wav|228|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_156.wav|228|The home side didn't stand a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_142.wav|228|He was in a great deal of pain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_004.wav|228|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_232.wav|228|We just had a go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_281.wav|228|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_248.wav|228|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_138.wav|228|We had a reunion last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_028.wav|228|There's a story, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_358.wav|228|The play is based on a real-life event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_114.wav|228|They will want to perform well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_322.wav|228|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_052.wav|228|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_264.wav|228|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_270.wav|228|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_046.wav|228|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_336.wav|228|It was forced to divert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_100.wav|228|We could not get any possession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_067.wav|228|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_251.wav|228|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_298.wav|228|It's certainly different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_121.wav|228|The picture is the same across Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_317.wav|228|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_192.wav|228|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_009.wav|228|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_186.wav|228|We knew nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_303.wav|228|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_135.wav|228|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_245.wav|228|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_073.wav|228|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_034.wav|228|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_202.wav|228|It's the same old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_172.wav|228|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_344.wav|228|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_108.wav|228|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_087.wav|228|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_278.wav|228|All options are open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_093.wav|228|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_350.wav|228|As, indeed, they would be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_166.wav|228|It was so new, so exciting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_216.wav|228|That will be vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_020.wav|228|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_284.wav|228|It changed my life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_147.wav|228|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_371.wav|228|It became a national network.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_001.wav|228|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_237.wav|228|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_223.wav|228|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_015.wav|228|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_365.wav|228|So there, we won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_153.wav|228|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_129.wav|228|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_290.wav|228|Graeme was prepared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_259.wav|228|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_349.wav|228|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_039.wav|228|She is believed to be in South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_275.wav|228|They were too hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_043.wav|228|It is urgent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_333.wav|228|I've got no secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_105.wav|228|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_111.wav|228|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_327.wav|228|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_057.wav|228|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_261.wav|228|His contract was then not renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_306.wav|228|Kids are terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_130.wav|228|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_240.wav|228|She was well balanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_289.wav|228|The home was now under new management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_076.wav|228|It's all I can do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_183.wav|228|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_197.wav|228|The procedure is the same in all cases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_368.wav|228|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_018.wav|228|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_062.wav|228|They're appalled by that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_254.wav|228|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_124.wav|228|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_312.wav|228|We do the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_007.wav|228|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_231.wav|228|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_188.wav|228|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_141.wav|228|I was the last man to touch the ball.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_282.wav|228|He was obviously very genuine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_296.wav|228|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_069.wav|228|He is a young man with a new deal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_319.wav|228|Is that an issue?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_363.wav|228|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_155.wav|228|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_225.wav|228|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_013.wav|228|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_048.wav|228|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_081.wav|228|People must remain vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_338.wav|228|This is a friendly match?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_174.wav|228|The post will be unpaid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_342.wav|228|It is not like working for a living.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_032.wav|228|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_204.wav|228|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_210.wav|228|They've got three-quarters of the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_026.wav|228|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_356.wav|228|Equity declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_160.wav|228|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_095.wav|228|Safety was also an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_185.wav|228|I took the gun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_246.wav|228|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_070.wav|228|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_300.wav|228|We want to play at the worlds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_136.wav|228|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_122.wav|228|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_064.wav|228|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_252.wav|228|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_228.wav|228|It is a gamble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_158.wav|228|The weather forecast isn't good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_191.wav|228|I put the drawing down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_335.wav|228|A great deal has been achieved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_103.wav|228|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_045.wav|228|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_209.wav|228|Who will pay for this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_179.wav|228|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_098.wav|228|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_051.wav|228|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_267.wav|228|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_117.wav|228|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_321.wav|228|Robert is a special talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_092.wav|228|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_217.wav|228|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_021.wav|228|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_351.wav|228|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_167.wav|228|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_173.wav|228|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_345.wav|228|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_035.wav|228|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_203.wav|228|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_086.wav|228|Nothing is yet confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_279.wav|228|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_109.wav|228|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_364.wav|228|It is a simple equation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_152.wav|228|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_222.wav|228|It's been a good year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_014.wav|228|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_291.wav|228|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_258.wav|228|They are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_128.wav|228|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_285.wav|228|The songs are just so good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_236.wav|228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_146.wav|228|I think he's the favourite, no question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_370.wav|228|It's a record label, not a form of music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_056.wav|228|That's the day job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_260.wav|228|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_110.wav|228|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_326.wav|228|It is a sign of hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_038.wav|228|President Bush is at war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_348.wav|228|Everyone was in tears.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_332.wav|228|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_104.wav|228|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_274.wav|228|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_042.wav|228|No meaningful response was issued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_019.wav|228|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_196.wav|228|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_369.wav|228|There is no signature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_125.wav|228|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_313.wav|228|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_063.wav|228|There was a battle there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_255.wav|228|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_241.wav|228|It's only fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_288.wav|228|It became a book by itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_077.wav|228|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_307.wav|228|The problems began a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_131.wav|228|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_182.wav|228|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_318.wav|228|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_297.wav|228|You are the glory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_068.wav|228|And if he hadn't become a musician?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_224.wav|228|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_012.wav|228|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_362.wav|228|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_154.wav|228|I am just trying to do my job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_189.wav|228|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_140.wav|228|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_006.wav|228|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_230.wav|228|You take a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_283.wav|228|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_357.wav|228|He later became a respected High Court judge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_161.wav|228|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_211.wav|228|He had suffered a heart attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_027.wav|228|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_094.wav|228|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_339.wav|228|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_049.wav|228|But it might have done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_033.wav|228|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_205.wav|228|I have a cold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_175.wav|228|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_343.wav|228|It's the last thing on my mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_065.wav|228|It's that kind of place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_253.wav|228|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_123.wav|228|It is so sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_315.wav|228|It's not long enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_159.wav|228|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_190.wav|228|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_229.wav|228|It's so special.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_184.wav|228|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_301.wav|228|We have waited a long time for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_137.wav|228|Who will attend?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_247.wav|228|He's a lovely young man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_071.wav|228|The script was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_116.wav|228|However, they will only be found in the wild.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_320.wav|228|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_099.wav|228|It is annoying.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_050.wav|228|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_266.wav|228|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_272.wav|228|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_044.wav|228|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_334.wav|228|Tiger is the exception.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_102.wav|228|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_178.wav|228|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p228/p228_208.wav|228|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_175.wav|229|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_343.wav|229|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_033.wav|229|And we have a singer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_205.wav|229|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_080.wav|229|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_339.wav|229|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_094.wav|229|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_211.wav|229|It's the same old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_027.wav|229|It's nice to hear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_357.wav|229|Tell us about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_161.wav|229|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_283.wav|229|It was a privilege to work for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_006.wav|229|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_230.wav|229|Who was on the panel?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_189.wav|229|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_140.wav|229|They took a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_376.wav|229|It is a simple equation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_362.wav|229|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_154.wav|229|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_224.wav|229|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_012.wav|229|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_297.wav|229|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_068.wav|229|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_318.wav|229|It's about my time as a guitarist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_387.wav|229|That team is due to be announced this morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_178.wav|229|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_334.wav|229|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_102.wav|229|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_272.wav|229|He was also married with two children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_044.wav|229|I was scared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_099.wav|229|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_050.wav|229|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_266.wav|229|That is highly unfair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_116.wav|229|I was angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_320.wav|229|It's not even finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_247.wav|229|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_071.wav|229|Neither it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_301.wav|229|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_137.wav|229|He is slightly confused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_184.wav|229|They thought they had found a home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_229.wav|229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_159.wav|229|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_190.wav|229|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_123.wav|229|I'm delighted about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_315.wav|229|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_065.wav|229|It is like a river running by my home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_253.wav|229|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_146.wav|229|I was the last man to touch the ball.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_370.wav|229|He could make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_236.wav|229|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_285.wav|229|If not, he should go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_128.wav|229|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_258.wav|229|Kirkwood was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_222.wav|229|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_014.wav|229|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_364.wav|229|It was fit for royalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_152.wav|229|We just had a go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_109.wav|229|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_086.wav|229|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_279.wav|229|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_035.wav|229|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_203.wav|229|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_173.wav|229|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_345.wav|229|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_351.wav|229|They may yet have the last laugh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_167.wav|229|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_217.wav|229|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_021.wav|229|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_092.wav|229|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_182.wav|229|It is a memorial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_307.wav|229|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_131.wav|229|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_241.wav|229|We were a load of rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_288.wav|229|I felt like I was a child.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_077.wav|229|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_063.wav|229|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_255.wav|229|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_125.wav|229|It is rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_313.wav|229|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_196.wav|229|Four policemen were wounded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_369.wav|229|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_019.wav|229|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_274.wav|229|We're in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_042.wav|229|He did not know his daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_332.wav|229|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_104.wav|229|We work on the same level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_381.wav|229|It does not even have a staff shortage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_348.wav|229|Look at the witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_038.wav|229|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_110.wav|229|I'm not depressed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_326.wav|229|I am very happy to be here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_056.wav|229|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_260.wav|229|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_095.wav|229|Until you hit the big games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_356.wav|229|It's the last thing on my mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_160.wav|229|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_210.wav|229|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_026.wav|229|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_032.wav|229|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_204.wav|229|Last night was a key episode.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_174.wav|229|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_342.wav|229|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_338.wav|229|It has moved on in the last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_048.wav|229|I am just going to go for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_081.wav|229|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_225.wav|229|The FBI could become involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_013.wav|229|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_363.wav|229|It benefits the whole family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_155.wav|229|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_319.wav|229|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_296.wav|229|Sunday's game was not a trial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_069.wav|229|Ferguson should take note.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_282.wav|229|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_188.wav|229|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_141.wav|229|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_377.wav|229|Talks are progressing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_007.wav|229|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_231.wav|229|We've got the bronze.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_117.wav|229|They were behind the wheel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_098.wav|229|She's got to say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_051.wav|229|It is difficult for Ali.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_267.wav|229|The warning is timely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_392.wav|229|Yet the data is compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_386.wav|229|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_179.wav|229|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_209.wav|229|I came home by ambulance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_273.wav|229|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_045.wav|229|It will come all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_335.wav|229|He told the court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_103.wav|229|It is a good day for the coalition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_158.wav|229|The home side didn't stand a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_191.wav|229|It is the whole package.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_228.wav|229|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_064.wav|229|We should have known.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_252.wav|229|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_122.wav|229|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_314.wav|229|It's certainly different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_300.wav|229|I was brought up in a mining background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_136.wav|229|So the European elections are extremely important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_246.wav|229|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_070.wav|229|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_185.wav|229|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_290.wav|229|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_259.wav|229|This is a big club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_129.wav|229|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_365.wav|229|We are looking for perfection.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_153.wav|229|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_223.wav|229|I am delighted for Simon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_015.wav|229|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_001.wav|229|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_237.wav|229|The track is currently covered in snow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_147.wav|229|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_371.wav|229|He later became a respected High Court judge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_284.wav|229|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_216.wav|229|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_020.wav|229|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_350.wav|229|I'm very lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_166.wav|229|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_093.wav|229|Well, the big day has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_087.wav|229|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_278.wav|229|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_108.wav|229|I didn't play well last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_172.wav|229|I will tell you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_344.wav|229|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_034.wav|229|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_202.wav|229|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_124.wav|229|I joined a group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_312.wav|229|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_062.wav|229|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_254.wav|229|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_018.wav|229|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_197.wav|229|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_368.wav|229|I am a star.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_183.wav|229|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_240.wav|229|We are so proud.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_289.wav|229|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_076.wav|229|I've not thought about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_306.wav|229|This is a war over our home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_130.wav|229|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_057.wav|229|She's a spy !
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_261.wav|229|I was happily surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_111.wav|229|It is normal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_333.wav|229|She did not attend the courtroom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_105.wav|229|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_275.wav|229|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_043.wav|229|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_039.wav|229|They're just different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_380.wav|229|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_349.wav|229|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_138.wav|229|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_281.wav|229|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_248.wav|229|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_004.wav|229|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_232.wav|229|Saturday is gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_142.wav|229|What will happen then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_374.wav|229|It is not too late to get on board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_360.wav|229|It was very formal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_156.wav|229|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_226.wav|229|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_010.wav|229|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_295.wav|229|These figures are truly awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_177.wav|229|It's that sort of night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_341.wav|229|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_388.wav|229|It has been a lovely family occasion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_031.wav|229|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_207.wav|229|I wanted to put myself on the line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_082.wav|229|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_119.wav|229|It's not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_269.wav|229|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_096.wav|229|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_213.wav|229|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_025.wav|229|Johnson was pretty low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_355.wav|229|It is long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_163.wav|229|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_245.wav|229|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_073.wav|229|It was chaotic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_303.wav|229|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_135.wav|229|It's an amazing landscape !
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_379.wav|229|It's a long process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_186.wav|229|Is Saddam a threat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_009.wav|229|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_192.wav|229|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_121.wav|229|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_067.wav|229|That was the easy election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_251.wav|229|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_298.wav|229|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_336.wav|229|The team for the first game could be this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_100.wav|229|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_270.wav|229|They are never here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_046.wav|229|But it took a lot of bottle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_052.wav|229|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_264.wav|229|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_114.wav|229|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_322.wav|229|It should be equal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_391.wav|229|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_358.wav|229|There is a cup final at stake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_028.wav|229|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_084.wav|229|He can do everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_037.wav|229|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_201.wav|229|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_171.wav|229|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_347.wav|229|I've got no secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_353.wav|229|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_165.wav|229|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_215.wav|229|The procedures were not in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_023.wav|229|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_059.wav|229|My mother is a widow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_090.wav|229|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_329.wav|229|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_144.wav|229|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_002.wav|229|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_234.wav|229|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_078.wav|229|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_287.wav|229|I saw it at a ruck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_308.wav|229|It's just not funny !
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_293.wav|229|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_220.wav|229|That is an important part of our role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_016.wav|229|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_366.wav|229|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_199.wav|229|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_150.wav|229|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_089.wav|229|It is a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_040.wav|229|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_330.wav|229|It could have gone either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_106.wav|229|Two of the team became ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_218.wav|229|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_168.wav|229|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_112.wav|229|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_324.wav|229|We are very strongly behind the bid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_054.wav|229|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_262.wav|229|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_239.wav|229|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_149.wav|229|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_180.wav|229|The post will be unpaid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_305.wav|229|There is no openness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_133.wav|229|She really suffered for her art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_243.wav|229|It's an idea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_075.wav|229|It works for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_061.wav|229|Art is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_257.wav|229|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_127.wav|229|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_311.wav|229|You are the glory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_194.wav|229|It is minute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_227.wav|229|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_011.wav|229|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_361.wav|229|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_157.wav|229|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_294.wav|229|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_280.wav|229|I am an estate agent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_249.wav|229|The letters are going out today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_139.wav|229|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_143.wav|229|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_005.wav|229|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_233.wav|229|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_268.wav|229|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_097.wav|229|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_118.wav|229|The fire was above the hole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_354.wav|229|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_162.wav|229|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_212.wav|229|But we are not immune to the problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_024.wav|229|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_030.wav|229|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_206.wav|229|It wasn't to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_176.wav|229|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_340.wav|229|He did a good job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_389.wav|229|That's the name of the game, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_083.wav|229|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_193.wav|229|We knew nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_066.wav|229|Try to save us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_250.wav|229|It's only fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_120.wav|229|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_316.wav|229|This is the culture change in medicine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_302.wav|229|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_134.wav|229|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_244.wav|229|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_072.wav|229|She died in hospital two hours later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_008.wav|229|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_378.wav|229|They play together perfectly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_187.wav|229|The home was now under new management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_115.wav|229|I came to complete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_323.wav|229|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_053.wav|229|A recording contract is on the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_265.wav|229|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_029.wav|229|I have a theory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_390.wav|229|There were no casualties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_359.wav|229|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_384.wav|229|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_271.wav|229|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_047.wav|229|But it is all by design.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_337.wav|229|They haven't got a hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_101.wav|229|She has so much to offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_214.wav|229|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_022.wav|229|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_352.wav|229|Everything was an effort.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_164.wav|229|I knew he was good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_328.wav|229|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_058.wav|229|What was the main difference?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_091.wav|229|We must look forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_085.wav|229|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_170.wav|229|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_346.wav|229|Indeed, it was magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_036.wav|229|I'd like to continue that record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_200.wav|229|I've got good news and bad news for you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_292.wav|229|We have other options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_367.wav|229|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_198.wav|229|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_151.wav|229|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_221.wav|229|She should not be blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_017.wav|229|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_003.wav|229|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_235.wav|229|The boy is no longer with us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_145.wav|229|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_373.wav|229|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_309.wav|229|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_079.wav|229|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_286.wav|229|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_169.wav|229|Was this element always there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_219.wav|229|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_055.wav|229|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_263.wav|229|The pensioners did not want to know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_113.wav|229|I don't have many friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_325.wav|229|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_331.wav|229|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_277.wav|229|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_088.wav|229|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_041.wav|229|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_382.wav|229|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_126.wav|229|Who would be a referee?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_310.wav|229|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_060.wav|229|And a film maker was born.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_256.wav|229|This year I understood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_195.wav|229|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_148.wav|229|Three penalties were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_181.wav|229|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_238.wav|229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_242.wav|229|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_074.wav|229|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_304.wav|229|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p229/p229_132.wav|229|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_368.wav|230|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_018.wav|230|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_254.wav|230|She took them for a term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_062.wav|230|Robin Williams is very subdued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_312.wav|230|The songs are just so good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_124.wav|230|She was also very brave.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_130.wav|230|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_306.wav|230|Rugby is now just like football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_076.wav|230|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_289.wav|230|In that moment, I was happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_240.wav|230|They need to win a trophy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_183.wav|230|They will run a mile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_327.wav|230|We have a good healthy debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_261.wav|230|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_057.wav|230|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_394.wav|230|I had a fortunate war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_349.wav|230|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_380.wav|230|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_039.wav|230|This will save interest charges.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_043.wav|230|The big problem is the lack of grass.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_105.wav|230|It is close to call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_333.wav|230|After some discussion they did.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_223.wav|230|How do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_153.wav|230|We are still getting over it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_365.wav|230|Alex Ferguson is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_129.wav|230|This is a successful outcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_259.wav|230|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_290.wav|230|The actor has met with Mandela.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_284.wav|230|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_417.wav|230|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_371.wav|230|My goal is quite simple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_147.wav|230|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_237.wav|230|Must have been at the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_001.wav|230|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_093.wav|230|But I know the course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_166.wav|230|We believe in the medium term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_399.wav|230|That investment has now been secured.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_350.wav|230|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_020.wav|230|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_216.wav|230|He has made his base in Spain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_202.wav|230|Tommy is not a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_034.wav|230|He really is a lovely man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_344.wav|230|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_172.wav|230|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_108.wav|230|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_278.wav|230|None of this work is guaranteed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_087.wav|230|It was not an insult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_392.wav|230|Clark is back on top form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_267.wav|230|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_051.wav|230|I have made that offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_321.wav|230|It is a road of death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_117.wav|230|Which can happen any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_103.wav|230|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_335.wav|230|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_045.wav|230|I was inspired by two things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_273.wav|230|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_209.wav|230|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_179.wav|230|It makes no influence on the public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_386.wav|230|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_314.wav|230|I can hardly believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_408.wav|230|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_122.wav|230|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_252.wav|230|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_064.wav|230|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_228.wav|230|He remains a main board director of Royal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_191.wav|230|We represent a wide range of society.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_158.wav|230|You had to go and see him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_185.wav|230|Our destiny is in our own hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_070.wav|230|It looks like a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_246.wav|230|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_300.wav|230|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_026.wav|230|Smoking is also very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_210.wav|230|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_160.wav|230|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_356.wav|230|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_095.wav|230|We intend to change the model.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_081.wav|230|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_048.wav|230|It was bound to happen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_338.wav|230|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_342.wav|230|In the old days, it was easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_174.wav|230|Phase one was a shambles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_204.wav|230|This is a holy place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_032.wav|230|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_069.wav|230|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_296.wav|230|It took a month and a half to film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_405.wav|230|It was a bank holiday, after all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_319.wav|230|McNaughton was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_155.wav|230|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_363.wav|230|Nobody else was with me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_013.wav|230|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_225.wav|230|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_231.wav|230|Things were so intense in the studio.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_007.wav|230|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_377.wav|230|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_141.wav|230|It has to be an event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_188.wav|230|He lives in a neighbouring village.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_411.wav|230|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_282.wav|230|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_077.wav|230|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_288.wav|230|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_241.wav|230|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_131.wav|230|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_307.wav|230|It could well be military.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_182.wav|230|I have spoken to head office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_019.wav|230|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_369.wav|230|They have broken the promise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_196.wav|230|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_313.wav|230|The casting is as perfect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_125.wav|230|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_255.wav|230|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_063.wav|230|The tournament has now been cancelled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_038.wav|230|They said she was stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_348.wav|230|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_381.wav|230|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_104.wav|230|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_332.wav|230|I can see their argument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_042.wav|230|People want to see me on the screen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_274.wav|230|We feel very good about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_260.wav|230|In fact, we were all over the shop.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_056.wav|230|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_326.wav|230|That meant the search was unlawful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_110.wav|230|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_395.wav|230|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_416.wav|230|No date has been set for a meeting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_285.wav|230|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_236.wav|230|It had so much to do with output.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_370.wav|230|We are really good friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_146.wav|230|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_152.wav|230|I'm afraid to say anything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_364.wav|230|We put our bid in last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_014.wav|230|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_222.wav|230|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_258.wav|230|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_291.wav|230|It was never a free kick.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_128.wav|230|He was a home referee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_402.wav|230|I've never seen a game like it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_345.wav|230|The airport was even different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_173.wav|230|But he has a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_203.wav|230|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_035.wav|230|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_279.wav|230|There is a case to answer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_086.wav|230|We will deal with the refugees.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_109.wav|230|Abbey National is an option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_092.wav|230|He was prepared for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_021.wav|230|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_217.wav|230|My life is in the ballet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_167.wav|230|It's nice to be nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_398.wav|230|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_351.wav|230|He is not very big, either.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_044.wav|230|That was the theory, anyway.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_272.wav|230|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_102.wav|230|This was a good move for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_334.wav|230|It was always an option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_178.wav|230|Tomorrow is a new day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_387.wav|230|There was a substantial explosion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_208.wav|230|This will take several weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_393.wav|230|Motion described it as a unique event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_116.wav|230|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_266.wav|230|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_050.wav|230|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_099.wav|230|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_184.wav|230|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_137.wav|230|These men are a part of India.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_071.wav|230|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_247.wav|230|Hospitals are for the ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_253.wav|230|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_065.wav|230|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_315.wav|230|I must do something about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_409.wav|230|It had been on the cards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_123.wav|230|We did what we had to do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_190.wav|230|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_159.wav|230|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_339.wav|230|The election is total confusion and chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_080.wav|230|It's so hard to shift.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_049.wav|230|We have to bring in new players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_205.wav|230|He had suffered a heart attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_033.wav|230|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_343.wav|230|There was some merit in that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_175.wav|230|City sentiment is in his favour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_161.wav|230|Are you from the rugby?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_357.wav|230|The professor said the results were positive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_027.wav|230|He has the courage of the unaware.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_211.wav|230|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_094.wav|230|You are like an animal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_376.wav|230|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_140.wav|230|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_189.wav|230|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_230.wav|230|That has been the easy part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_006.wav|230|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_283.wav|230|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_410.wav|230|The second goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_404.wav|230|It does not even have a staff shortage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_318.wav|230|They are not left wing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_068.wav|230|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_297.wav|230|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_012.wav|230|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_224.wav|230|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_154.wav|230|It has to be now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_362.wav|230|I am a lucky man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_325.wav|230|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_113.wav|230|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_263.wav|230|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_055.wav|230|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_219.wav|230|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_396.wav|230|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_169.wav|230|On the month the weakness was across the board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_382.wav|230|I always knew she was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_041.wav|230|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_088.wav|230|You might not make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_277.wav|230|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_107.wav|230|It is a total and utter change of culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_331.wav|230|This ruling is a farce.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_195.wav|230|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_060.wav|230|It's not covered by the insurance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_310.wav|230|We have a clean bill of health.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_126.wav|230|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_132.wav|230|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_304.wav|230|I was there five months ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_074.wav|230|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_242.wav|230|It is possible to be too good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_238.wav|230|She died in middle age.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_181.wav|230|He played it like a veteran.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_148.wav|230|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_091.wav|230|The conclusion is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_058.wav|230|It was exactly four months away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_328.wav|230|I would do away with the dress code.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_164.wav|230|Our position remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_352.wav|230|I have a moral dilemma.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_214.wav|230|We used to live with dignity in our country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_200.wav|230|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_036.wav|230|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_346.wav|230|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_170.wav|230|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_085.wav|230|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_017.wav|230|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_221.wav|230|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_151.wav|230|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_198.wav|230|I made a terrible start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_367.wav|230|But BA said the prediction was premature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_401.wav|230|You will not feel a thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_292.wav|230|It is a recipe for success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_286.wav|230|That was a gold medal for certain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_079.wav|230|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_309.wav|230|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_415.wav|230|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_373.wav|230|It's going to be fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_145.wav|230|She has gone to the Catholic school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_235.wav|230|It is the voice of the survivors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_003.wav|230|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_316.wav|230|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_120.wav|230|They are very happy with the new settlement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_299.wav|230|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_250.wav|230|We have to compete at our own level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_066.wav|230|He also received a medal of honour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_378.wav|230|We are a Scottish company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_008.wav|230|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_072.wav|230|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_244.wav|230|Here is a question for you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_134.wav|230|It was a piece of art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_302.wav|230|He is at war with his knee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_359.wav|230|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_390.wav|230|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_029.wav|230|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_265.wav|230|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_053.wav|230|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_323.wav|230|The group is not paying a dividend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_115.wav|230|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_101.wav|230|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_337.wav|230|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_047.wav|230|I must take a seat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_271.wav|230|On the contrary they stand to gain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_384.wav|230|The marshall at the turn was great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_407.wav|230|The casualties were not named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_157.wav|230|They will do their own thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_361.wav|230|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_227.wav|230|It was a day for records.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_233.wav|230|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_005.wav|230|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_375.wav|230|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_143.wav|230|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_139.wav|230|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_413.wav|230|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_249.wav|230|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_280.wav|230|We're trying to get rounded performers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_024.wav|230|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_212.wav|230|There is no quick fix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_162.wav|230|Had I heard?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_354.wav|230|You have no chance of planning permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_118.wav|230|It is too pretty, it is too small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_097.wav|230|Two of the team became ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_268.wav|230|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_083.wav|230|It might change your life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_389.wav|230|He could face a jail sentence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_340.wav|230|You may have a short memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_176.wav|230|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_206.wav|230|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_030.wav|230|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_383.wav|230|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_106.wav|230|It is an impressive record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_330.wav|230|This is a historic occasion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_040.wav|230|Well, he is an artist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_089.wav|230|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_276.wav|230|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_262.wav|230|Persuaded to change his mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_054.wav|230|We should be able to cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_324.wav|230|We were on our way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_112.wav|230|We have the mental strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_397.wav|230|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_168.wav|230|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_218.wav|230|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_075.wav|230|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_243.wav|230|In many ways, that is as important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_133.wav|230|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_305.wav|230|You have to see it like this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_180.wav|230|She has left the island.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_149.wav|230|However, he was later released without charge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_239.wav|230|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_194.wav|230|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_311.wav|230|And we can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_127.wav|230|The opposite is the case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_257.wav|230|Nato was not a love affair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_061.wav|230|But the challenge is in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_347.wav|230|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_171.wav|230|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_201.wav|230|Racism has no place in any sport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_037.wav|230|The boy is no longer with us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_084.wav|230|You are a great player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_329.wav|230|We are on a four-year mission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_090.wav|230|I did not have a bet on myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_059.wav|230|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_023.wav|230|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_215.wav|230|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_165.wav|230|Nobody did in those days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_353.wav|230|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_308.wav|230|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_414.wav|230|It is the old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_287.wav|230|You get a lot for your money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_078.wav|230|This is a true story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_234.wav|230|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_002.wav|230|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_372.wav|230|This is a major championship.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_144.wav|230|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_150.wav|230|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_199.wav|230|The result is called a patent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_366.wav|230|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_016.wav|230|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_220.wav|230|His second was a beauty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_293.wav|230|I would rather look at him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_400.wav|230|It is a large number.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_009.wav|230|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_186.wav|230|He prefers to play for them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_379.wav|230|We will win the argument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_135.wav|230|I would relish the prospect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_303.wav|230|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_073.wav|230|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_245.wav|230|I was just a kid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_298.wav|230|It is a symbolic concert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_251.wav|230|They showed a lot of heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_317.wav|230|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_121.wav|230|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_192.wav|230|We always felt we could win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_046.wav|230|If not, he should go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_270.wav|230|I was ready for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_100.wav|230|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_336.wav|230|Did it work?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_385.wav|230|If you can get it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_028.wav|230|Life was like a timetable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_358.wav|230|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_391.wav|230|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_322.wav|230|The party lasted all night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_114.wav|230|That admission is not surprising.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_264.wav|230|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_052.wav|230|None has ever been found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_374.wav|230|She is now on the back benches.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_142.wav|230|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_232.wav|230|I was not sure whether I had won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_248.wav|230|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_281.wav|230|They can leave at any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_138.wav|230|I was caught out a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_406.wav|230|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_295.wav|230|It's got to come from me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_010.wav|230|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_226.wav|230|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_156.wav|230|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_360.wav|230|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_207.wav|230|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_031.wav|230|I'm so happy that she did.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_388.wav|230|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_341.wav|230|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_177.wav|230|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_163.wav|230|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_355.wav|230|We are encouraged by the news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_025.wav|230|It is on the internet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_213.wav|230|All will be revealed in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_096.wav|230|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_269.wav|230|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p230/p230_119.wav|230|But this time we can have no excuses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_264.wav|231|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_052.wav|231|We have not given up hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_322.wav|231|We want to play at the worlds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_114.wav|231|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_358.wav|231|I am a lucky man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_391.wav|231|The response from them was good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_444.wav|231|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_028.wav|231|There was a rush of water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_450.wav|231|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_385.wav|231|You have to rely on each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_100.wav|231|No, the equipment is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_336.wav|231|I think it's about time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_046.wav|231|I was inspired by two things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_270.wav|231|On the contrary they stand to gain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_471.wav|231|Dennis was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_192.wav|231|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_317.wav|231|They come to enjoy themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_121.wav|231|I was just a child.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_298.wav|231|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_251.wav|231|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_067.wav|231|Only water is currently allowed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_073.wav|231|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_245.wav|231|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_135.wav|231|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_303.wav|231|I was just so determined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_186.wav|231|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_465.wav|231|She has now been registered as disabled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_379.wav|231|The pair are very much in love.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_009.wav|231|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_433.wav|231|It is based on a true story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_119.wav|231|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_269.wav|231|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_025.wav|231|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_213.wav|231|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_449.wav|231|And we might go back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_163.wav|231|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_355.wav|231|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_388.wav|231|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_341.wav|231|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_177.wav|231|The Hibs manager is no fool.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_207.wav|231|You've caught a serial killer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_031.wav|231|The Premier League has been a huge success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_082.wav|231|It's so hard to shift.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_427.wav|231|I would love to think that she could win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_156.wav|231|It is a terrible tragedy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_360.wav|231|I've always been a sensitive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_010.wav|231|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_226.wav|231|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_295.wav|231|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_406.wav|231|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_138.wav|231|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_412.wav|231|I will always remember the horrible images.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_248.wav|231|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_281.wav|231|They can leave at any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_232.wav|231|She died in middle age.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_004.wav|231|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_374.wav|231|There is no deal as yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_142.wav|231|It only increased the support for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_468.wav|231|War is not the action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_257.wav|231|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_061.wav|231|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_127.wav|231|This should begin in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_194.wav|231|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_239.wav|231|My future is in the marathon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_180.wav|231|I have spoken to head office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_463.wav|231|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_149.wav|231|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_419.wav|231|The case will now go to appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_133.wav|231|It is a common problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_305.wav|231|The judge was really nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_243.wav|231|Nato was not a love affair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_218.wav|231|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_397.wav|231|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_168.wav|231|Well, this article is a bit like that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_442.wav|231|The people are the hero.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_324.wav|231|We have got no money to go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_112.wav|231|There's still plenty time left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_438.wav|231|They are not left wing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_262.wav|231|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_054.wav|231|She said she was really sorry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_040.wav|231|Last year, I was pretty bad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_089.wav|231|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_276.wav|231|These figures are truly terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_106.wav|231|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_330.wav|231|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_456.wav|231|They have to be met.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_383.wav|231|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_400.wav|231|I had a fortunate war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_293.wav|231|This could be a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_016.wav|231|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_220.wav|231|And the World Cup has not even begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_150.wav|231|We have a clean bill of health.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_199.wav|231|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_366.wav|231|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_372.wav|231|But we finished the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_144.wav|231|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_234.wav|231|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_002.wav|231|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_078.wav|231|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_308.wav|231|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_414.wav|231|They are looking for profit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_165.wav|231|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_353.wav|231|The units will not be replaced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_023.wav|231|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_215.wav|231|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_090.wav|231|I saw the whole thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_059.wav|231|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_435.wav|231|I never won a penny throughout my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_329.wav|231|The problems began a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_421.wav|231|There is a solution, she believes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_201.wav|231|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_037.wav|231|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_347.wav|231|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_171.wav|231|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_451.wav|231|We went straight into the bedroom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_384.wav|231|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_047.wav|231|A win is a win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_271.wav|231|I thought he might have been a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_101.wav|231|That time is not now, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_337.wav|231|The airport was even different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_323.wav|231|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_115.wav|231|January is a bad time of year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_265.wav|231|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_053.wav|231|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_029.wav|231|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_359.wav|231|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_390.wav|231|It was fit for royalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_445.wav|231|It sounded like a bomb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_134.wav|231|You're a gambling man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_302.wav|231|It could well be military.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_072.wav|231|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_244.wav|231|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_008.wav|231|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_464.wav|231|Driving has been the key.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_378.wav|231|to have products for their needs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_470.wav|231|It is too early to speculate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_193.wav|231|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_299.wav|231|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_250.wav|231|The baby deserves the credit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_066.wav|231|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_316.wav|231|We're on our way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_120.wav|231|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_206.wav|231|It gave no further details.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_030.wav|231|That deal is a joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_389.wav|231|That time may never be broken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_340.wav|231|At first, the youngster was not keen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_176.wav|231|This much I can tell you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_426.wav|231|My aim is a top six finish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_083.wav|231|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_097.wav|231|We should recognise others have done a good job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_268.wav|231|I've had the time of my life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_432.wav|231|I never had a childhood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_118.wav|231|Then again, we could have.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_448.wav|231|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_162.wav|231|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_354.wav|231|Neither man has been charged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_024.wav|231|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_212.wav|231|Which isn't a bad idea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_249.wav|231|This ruling is a farce.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_280.wav|231|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_139.wav|231|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_375.wav|231|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_143.wav|231|Anyone can do the sums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_469.wav|231|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_233.wav|231|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_005.wav|231|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_011.wav|231|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_157.wav|231|He was right into football from an early age.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_361.wav|231|Glasgow is a friendly city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_407.wav|231|There was an element of frustration.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_294.wav|231|Once again, they would be wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_181.wav|231|I am not ready to walk away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_462.wav|231|Let that be their memorial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_148.wav|231|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_238.wav|231|The minister is the engineer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_074.wav|231|Both men were on one-year contracts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_242.wav|231|She took them for a term.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_418.wav|231|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_132.wav|231|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_304.wav|231|That was the difference between the sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_310.wav|231|McNaughton was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_126.wav|231|It is too pretty, it is too small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_256.wav|231|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_476.wav|231|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_195.wav|231|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_107.wav|231|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_331.wav|231|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_041.wav|231|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_088.wav|231|He's been hit by it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_277.wav|231|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_457.wav|231|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_382.wav|231|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_396.wav|231|He put some colour into Scottish history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_169.wav|231|It is really good news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_443.wav|231|They made a huge impression on me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_219.wav|231|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_263.wav|231|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_055.wav|231|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_325.wav|231|Have a look at this lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_113.wav|231|It proved a good decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_439.wav|231|The British government does not want to know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_235.wav|231|The irony was not lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_003.wav|231|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_373.wav|231|They were to blame for the first two goals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_145.wav|231|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_309.wav|231|He is still in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_415.wav|231|I remain a buyer of the shares.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_286.wav|231|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_079.wav|231|Both agreed on the success of the event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_292.wav|231|I've lost all confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_401.wav|231|She is in their hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_151.wav|231|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_198.wav|231|It was a moment of madness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_367.wav|231|You need a licence to run a pub.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_017.wav|231|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_221.wav|231|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_085.wav|231|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_420.wav|231|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_346.wav|231|We are encouraged by the news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_170.wav|231|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_200.wav|231|Libya is an easy target.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_036.wav|231|But he can turn on the charm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_214.wav|231|He also presented You Bet!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_164.wav|231|He was in great spirits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_352.wav|231|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_434.wav|231|But it can be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_328.wav|231|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_091.wav|231|But I know the course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_058.wav|231|We should be able to cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_229.wav|231|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_473.wav|231|It was clear on Thursday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_190.wav|231|I'm interested in interesting work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_159.wav|231|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_315.wav|231|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_409.wav|231|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_123.wav|231|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_253.wav|231|It was a cry for help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_065.wav|231|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_071.wav|231|He highlighted a lack of staff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_247.wav|231|Persuaded to change his mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_137.wav|231|This is a successful outcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_301.wav|231|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_184.wav|231|So many people will be affected by this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_467.wav|231|Classes must be reduced by half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_266.wav|231|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_050.wav|231|It is a symbolic concert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_099.wav|231|Two of the team became ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_320.wav|231|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_116.wav|231|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_393.wav|231|But we are very near.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_446.wav|231|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_208.wav|231|I won't make an official complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_178.wav|231|We are the gateway to justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_452.wav|231|Its future is no longer in question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_387.wav|231|I wanted to go out on a high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_102.wav|231|It's not a quick fix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_428.wav|231|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_334.wav|231|She is now on the back benches.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_044.wav|231|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_272.wav|231|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_154.wav|231|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_362.wav|231|You did not see it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_012.wav|231|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_224.wav|231|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_068.wav|231|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_297.wav|231|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_404.wav|231|It is hard to understand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_318.wav|231|That meant the search was unlawful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_283.wav|231|You get a lot for your money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_230.wav|231|They are the innocent victims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_006.wav|231|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_376.wav|231|We were given a break.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_140.wav|231|I think he's the favourite, no question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_189.wav|231|You know the sort of thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_431.wav|231|I was in jail for five years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_094.wav|231|You are like an animal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_027.wav|231|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_211.wav|231|They are looking at flotation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_161.wav|231|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_357.wav|231|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_343.wav|231|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_175.wav|231|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_205.wav|231|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_033.wav|231|It carried a double message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_080.wav|231|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_049.wav|231|There's nothing we could do about this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_339.wav|231|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_395.wav|231|A review is under way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_440.wav|231|They said they were only young men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_326.wav|231|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_110.wav|231|You'd better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_260.wav|231|The concerns are the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_056.wav|231|Italy is a beautiful place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_042.wav|231|Among them are many criminals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_274.wav|231|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_104.wav|231|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_332.wav|231|In the old days, it was easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_454.wav|231|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_348.wav|231|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_381.wav|231|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_038.wav|231|The man became a reporter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_255.wav|231|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_063.wav|231|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_313.wav|231|I thought he did very well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_125.wav|231|That period was a struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_369.wav|231|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_475.wav|231|It was all in a short period of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_196.wav|231|I came home by ambulance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_019.wav|231|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_461.wav|231|They were good years for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_131.wav|231|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_307.wav|231|You are a different people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_288.wav|231|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_241.wav|231|The parties have no contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_167.wav|231|It is simply not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_398.wav|231|They have failed to deliver.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_351.wav|231|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_021.wav|231|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_217.wav|231|He has a lot of skill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_092.wav|231|Their attitude is all wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_437.wav|231|The growth potential is enormous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_423.wav|231|It was important to win the singles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_109.wav|231|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_279.wav|231|At first I thought I was gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_086.wav|231|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_203.wav|231|What are you no good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_035.wav|231|I became a widow overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_345.wav|231|Finally came the moment of truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_459.wav|231|But he has a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_173.wav|231|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_128.wav|231|That is far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_402.wav|231|It is a large number.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_258.wav|231|It seems a shame to leave it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_291.wav|231|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_014.wav|231|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_222.wav|231|That you can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_152.wav|231|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_364.wav|231|It is not real life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_370.wav|231|This is a major championship.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_146.wav|231|It has become a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_236.wav|231|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_285.wav|231|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_416.wav|231|There is some light in the tunnel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_136.wav|231|He is a great addition to our team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_300.wav|231|But it is up again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_070.wav|231|This is an exciting new venture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_246.wav|231|His is a global perspective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_185.wav|231|As many as the market will support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_466.wav|231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_472.wav|231|He felt it was the right time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_191.wav|231|We represent a wide range of society.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_158.wav|231|It is not like us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_228.wav|231|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_252.wav|231|But they were never expected to last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_064.wav|231|It was a lovely experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_314.wav|231|I'm not making any comment at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_408.wav|231|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_122.wav|231|We should not be surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_179.wav|231|But one was not enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_453.wav|231|We put our bid in last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_386.wav|231|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_209.wav|231|We are a new department.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_045.wav|231|I guess I was lucky, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_273.wav|231|I'd never run for them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_103.wav|231|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_429.wav|231|He is on the wrong side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_117.wav|231|It is much as it has been described.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_267.wav|231|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_051.wav|231|We keep an eye on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_098.wav|231|We live by the rule of law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_392.wav|231|There was a substantial explosion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_447.wav|231|We've got a good management record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_282.wav|231|That view has not altered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_411.wav|231|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_377.wav|231|In due course the deal was done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_141.wav|231|I miss the freedom that I had.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_188.wav|231|This is the time to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_231.wav|231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_007.wav|231|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_013.wav|231|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_225.wav|231|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_155.wav|231|The strong pound also took its toll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_363.wav|231|We live on an island.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_405.wav|231|It was a bank holiday, after all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_319.wav|231|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_069.wav|231|We need to increase the membership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_296.wav|231|It's all designed to speed up the service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_032.wav|231|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_342.wav|231|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_174.wav|231|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_338.wav|231|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_424.wav|231|The road was closed for several hours.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_081.wav|231|On Saturday, it was much the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_048.wav|231|There was no safety net.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_095.wav|231|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_430.wav|231|It was a breathtaking moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_160.wav|231|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_026.wav|231|I'd just like to play.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_210.wav|231|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_105.wav|231|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_333.wav|231|However, the groups denied the claims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_043.wav|231|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_275.wav|231|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_039.wav|231|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_349.wav|231|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_380.wav|231|We will win the argument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_394.wav|231|That's as good as it gets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_441.wav|231|We shall not forget him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_261.wav|231|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_057.wav|231|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_327.wav|231|The king is delighted by the honour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_111.wav|231|New Year will be very busy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_183.wav|231|The shooting created panic in the street.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_460.wav|231|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_076.wav|231|That would be too easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_289.wav|231|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_240.wav|231|It is now the big brother.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_130.wav|231|It plans to return to this field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_312.wav|231|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_124.wav|231|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_254.wav|231|No production contract is yet in sight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_062.wav|231|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_018.wav|231|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_368.wav|231|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_474.wav|231|The casting of her husband was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_197.wav|231|I suggest a new plan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_278.wav|231|The joint bid is still on course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_087.wav|231|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_422.wav|231|Yet the data is compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_108.wav|231|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_344.wav|231|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_458.wav|231|She has reached the top of her profession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_172.wav|231|My life has been destroyed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_202.wav|231|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_034.wav|231|That means an extra two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_020.wav|231|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_216.wav|231|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_166.wav|231|You've been a great audience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_399.wav|231|Clark is back on top form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_350.wav|231|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_436.wav|231|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_093.wav|231|We must stop it with the golf ball.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_237.wav|231|Hospitals are for the ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_001.wav|231|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_371.wav|231|The result is called a patent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_147.wav|231|The whole industry is a shambles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_417.wav|231|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_284.wav|231|Blair also had a penalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_259.wav|231|It was the climax of the thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_290.wav|231|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_129.wav|231|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_403.wav|231|It does not even have a staff shortage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_153.wav|231|He was asked to quit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_365.wav|231|Neither woman has been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_015.wav|231|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p231/p231_223.wav|231|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_150.wav|232|She had gone to the Catholic school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_199.wav|232|The service from the other players was super.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_366.wav|232|It benefits the whole family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_016.wav|232|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_220.wav|232|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_293.wav|232|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_400.wav|232|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_308.wav|232|We are in the end game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_414.wav|232|I was very young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_287.wav|232|It happens from time to time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_078.wav|232|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_234.wav|232|But she was.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_002.wav|232|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_372.wav|232|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_144.wav|232|The home side didn't stand a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_329.wav|232|We agreed to disagree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_090.wav|232|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_059.wav|232|That's the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_023.wav|232|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_215.wav|232|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_165.wav|232|Again, we were lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_353.wav|232|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_347.wav|232|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_171.wav|232|My life has been destroyed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_201.wav|232|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_037.wav|232|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_084.wav|232|I will miss him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_194.wav|232|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_311.wav|232|Special measures were needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_127.wav|232|It has removed a bit of guilt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_257.wav|232|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_061.wav|232|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_075.wav|232|The price cuts are really exciting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_243.wav|232|It's a lovely, lovely film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_133.wav|232|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_305.wav|232|They are wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_180.wav|232|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_149.wav|232|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_239.wav|232|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_262.wav|232|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_054.wav|232|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_324.wav|232|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_112.wav|232|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_397.wav|232|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_168.wav|232|That will do for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_218.wav|232|He seemed to lose his focus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_383.wav|232|Talks are progressing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_106.wav|232|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_330.wav|232|It could have gone either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_040.wav|232|Dancing was her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_089.wav|232|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_276.wav|232|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_163.wav|232|It is not too late to get on board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_355.wav|232|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_025.wav|232|Johnson was pretty low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_213.wav|232|He is slightly confused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_096.wav|232|Then came the crunch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_269.wav|232|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_119.wav|232|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_082.wav|232|What has changed?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_207.wav|232|I don't want to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_031.wav|232|It's a matter of balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_388.wav|232|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_341.wav|232|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_177.wav|232|Blair's response was weak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_406.wav|232|He was a crazy man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_295.wav|232|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_010.wav|232|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_226.wav|232|Mental health is a massive issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_156.wav|232|It is an attitude of mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_360.wav|232|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_374.wav|232|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_142.wav|232|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_232.wav|232|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_004.wav|232|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_248.wav|232|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_281.wav|232|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_138.wav|232|What will happen then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_412.wav|232|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_028.wav|232|They should be so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_358.wav|232|It's not that clear-cut.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_391.wav|232|You thought it was a headache.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_322.wav|232|However, the groups denied the claims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_114.wav|232|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_264.wav|232|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_052.wav|232|We were surprised to see the photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_046.wav|232|The judge said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_270.wav|232|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_100.wav|232|It was mayhem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_336.wav|232|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_385.wav|232|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_298.wav|232|He should have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_251.wav|232|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_067.wav|232|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_317.wav|232|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_121.wav|232|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_192.wav|232|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_009.wav|232|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_186.wav|232|It is the whole package.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_379.wav|232|They have not done so this season so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_135.wav|232|Our intentions are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_303.wav|232|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_073.wav|232|There could be a way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_245.wav|232|Broke the birdie record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_286.wav|232|It was a privilege to work for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_079.wav|232|He is now resident in England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_309.wav|232|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_415.wav|232|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_373.wav|232|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_145.wav|232|We want to see the maximum of change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_235.wav|232|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_003.wav|232|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_017.wav|232|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_221.wav|232|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_151.wav|232|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_198.wav|232|The conference is the first test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_367.wav|232|He has seen the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_401.wav|232|It is legally binding.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_292.wav|232|The attacker died in the crash.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_200.wav|232|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_036.wav|232|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_346.wav|232|Tiger is the exception.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_170.wav|232|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_085.wav|232|It's all going to clear the debt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_091.wav|232|It is a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_058.wav|232|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_328.wav|232|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_164.wav|232|That must be left to the Parole Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_352.wav|232|The boat was fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_022.wav|232|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_214.wav|232|She should not be blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_132.wav|232|I am now unemployed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_074.wav|232|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_242.wav|232|It's quite a line-up!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_238.wav|232|And thought we would get away with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_181.wav|232|The clarity is vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_148.wav|232|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_195.wav|232|I wanted to put myself on the line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_256.wav|232|A friendship that will endure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_060.wav|232|That is very hard, alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_310.wav|232|He was solid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_126.wav|232|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_382.wav|232|Five members were disciplined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_041.wav|232|I suspect the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_088.wav|232|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_277.wav|232|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_107.wav|232|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_331.wav|232|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_325.wav|232|Off with their heads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_113.wav|232|It's not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_263.wav|232|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_055.wav|232|It's very odd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_219.wav|232|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_396.wav|232|I can lead by example.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_169.wav|232|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_083.wav|232|That is bound to happen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_389.wav|232|It has moved on in the last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_340.wav|232|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_176.wav|232|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_206.wav|232|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_030.wav|232|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_024.wav|232|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_162.wav|232|Tell it like it was?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_354.wav|232|It is long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_118.wav|232|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_097.wav|232|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_268.wav|232|Of course, that is not the whole story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_233.wav|232|The track is currently covered in snow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_005.wav|232|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_375.wav|232|It was a double tragedy for the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_143.wav|232|They did very well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_139.wav|232|I am totally devoted to this job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_413.wav|232|It was that bad, that low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_249.wav|232|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_280.wav|232|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_294.wav|232|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_407.wav|232|We should have known.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_361.wav|232|I kept going for her.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_011.wav|232|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_227.wav|232|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_101.wav|232|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_337.wav|232|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_047.wav|232|It is difficult for Ali.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_271.wav|232|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_384.wav|232|There is no signature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_359.wav|232|She is free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_390.wav|232|That's the name of the game, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_029.wav|232|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_265.wav|232|Blood samples were taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_053.wav|232|It's the big omission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_323.wav|232|I came into this world with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_115.wav|232|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_187.wav|232|I've been there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_378.wav|232|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_008.wav|232|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_072.wav|232|That was the easy election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_244.wav|232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_134.wav|232|You've got to be vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_302.wav|232|Nothing is safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_316.wav|232|It should be equal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_120.wav|232|It is rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_299.wav|232|He has retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_250.wav|232|He says that he is no different from any other man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_066.wav|232|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_193.wav|232|The procedure is the same in all cases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_092.wav|232|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_021.wav|232|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_217.wav|232|It's not ideal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_167.wav|232|Waiting times for these services are too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_398.wav|232|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_351.wav|232|Everything was an effort.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_345.wav|232|Indeed, it was magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_173.wav|232|It became a book by itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_203.wav|232|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_035.wav|232|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_279.wav|232|Finally, he paid for the movie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_086.wav|232|She had kept the news from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_109.wav|232|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_152.wav|232|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_364.wav|232|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_014.wav|232|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_258.wav|232|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_291.wav|232|They were also beside themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_128.wav|232|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_402.wav|232|We knew nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_285.wav|232|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_236.wav|232|We were awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_370.wav|232|We will be homeless.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_146.wav|232|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_260.wav|232|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_056.wav|232|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_326.wav|232|It's not long enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_110.wav|232|I don't have many friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_395.wav|232|We're looking for justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_038.wav|232|It was fit for royalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_348.wav|232|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_381.wav|232|Well, the big day has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_104.wav|232|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_332.wav|232|Horses are drawn by ballot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_042.wav|232|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_274.wav|232|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_019.wav|232|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_369.wav|232|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_196.wav|232|I came home by ambulance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_313.wav|232|I never thought it would take this long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_125.wav|232|I'm so angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_255.wav|232|It's a record label, not a form of music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_063.wav|232|You do not change overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_077.wav|232|It was chaotic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_288.wav|232|He looked very sharp.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_241.wav|232|It's quite nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_131.wav|232|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_307.wav|232|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_182.wav|232|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_404.wav|232|This is a huge confidence boost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_318.wav|232|The home team had an amazing start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_068.wav|232|It is like a river running by my home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_297.wav|232|These figures are truly awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_012.wav|232|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_224.wav|232|That has been the easy part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_154.wav|232|They were later discharged from hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_362.wav|232|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_376.wav|232|He could make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_140.wav|232|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_189.wav|232|They receive a high profile in the media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_230.wav|232|I am immensely sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_006.wav|232|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_283.wav|232|I am an estate agent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_410.wav|232|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_161.wav|232|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_357.wav|232|He had played well in that central role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_027.wav|232|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_211.wav|232|Feel the heat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_094.wav|232|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_339.wav|232|They haven't got a hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_080.wav|232|I've got the shirt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_049.wav|232|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_205.wav|232|It's a mixture of everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_033.wav|232|I would love it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_343.wav|232|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_175.wav|232|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_253.wav|232|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_065.wav|232|He was popular.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_315.wav|232|Kids are terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_409.wav|232|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_123.wav|232|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_190.wav|232|We did everything by the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_159.wav|232|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_229.wav|232|What was the main difference?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_184.wav|232|A career as a doctor is on hold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_137.wav|232|The goals were good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_301.wav|232|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_071.wav|232|Painful, but only because it's true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_247.wav|232|She is well balanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_393.wav|232|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_320.wav|232|Referees are easy targets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_116.wav|232|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_266.wav|232|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_050.wav|232|They had to explain it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_099.wav|232|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_044.wav|232|We will push.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_272.wav|232|He is a young man with a new deal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_102.wav|232|It was a good performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_334.wav|232|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_178.wav|232|It's the real thing, for sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_387.wav|232|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_208.wav|232|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_202.wav|232|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_034.wav|232|It is marvellous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_344.wav|232|He has to learn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_172.wav|232|They thought they had found a home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_108.wav|232|He pleaded for caution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_278.wav|232|They wanted the club to make money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_087.wav|232|No progress has been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_093.wav|232|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_166.wav|232|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_399.wav|232|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_350.wav|232|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_020.wav|232|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_216.wav|232|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_284.wav|232|The record companies have gone through the floor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_371.wav|232|The scene is about this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_147.wav|232|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_237.wav|232|However, no further action was taken by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_001.wav|232|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_015.wav|232|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_223.wav|232|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_153.wav|232|I was in daily contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_365.wav|232|However, it was well worth the wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_129.wav|232|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_403.wav|232|My house was shaking at the time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_259.wav|232|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_290.wav|232|I saw it at a ruck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_349.wav|232|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_380.wav|232|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_039.wav|232|I was scared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_043.wav|232|But it took a lot of bottle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_275.wav|232|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_105.wav|232|That is no use.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_333.wav|232|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_327.wav|232|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_111.wav|232|He was jailed for a year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_261.wav|232|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_057.wav|232|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_394.wav|232|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_130.wav|232|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_306.wav|232|It is a road of death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_076.wav|232|I had my suspicions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_289.wav|232|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_240.wav|232|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_183.wav|232|Everyone can be bought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_368.wav|232|It was one in the afternoon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_197.wav|232|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_018.wav|232|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_254.wav|232|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_062.wav|232|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_312.wav|232|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_124.wav|232|That's all right then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_231.wav|232|I'd never seen a play about me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_007.wav|232|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_377.wav|232|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_141.wav|232|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_188.wav|232|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_411.wav|232|You wanted the evidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_282.wav|232|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_069.wav|232|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_296.wav|232|He was obviously very genuine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_405.wav|232|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_319.wav|232|For the moment, our position remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_155.wav|232|This latter point is hugely important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_363.wav|232|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_013.wav|232|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_225.wav|232|We've got the bronze.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_081.wav|232|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_048.wav|232|But it might have done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_338.wav|232|The team for the first game could be this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_342.wav|232|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_174.wav|232|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_204.wav|232|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_032.wav|232|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_026.wav|232|But it failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_210.wav|232|That's the day job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_160.wav|232|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_356.wav|232|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_095.wav|232|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_185.wav|232|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_070.wav|232|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_246.wav|232|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_136.wav|232|They took a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_300.wav|232|What has altered?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_314.wav|232|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_408.wav|232|Feel the air, the space.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_122.wav|232|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_252.wav|232|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_064.wav|232|People love to see this stuff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_228.wav|232|It was good fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_191.wav|232|I wish I could say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_158.wav|232|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_103.wav|232|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_335.wav|232|She did not attend the courtroom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_045.wav|232|It is urgent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_273.wav|232|He was also married with two children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_209.wav|232|There was an e-mail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_179.wav|232|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_386.wav|232|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_392.wav|232|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_267.wav|232|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_051.wav|232|Here's a clue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_098.wav|232|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_321.wav|232|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p232/p232_117.wav|232|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_095.wav|233|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_160.wav|233|I was so nervous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_356.wav|233|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_026.wav|233|But we will have to wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_210.wav|233|He had suffered a heart attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_204.wav|233|It wasn't to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_032.wav|233|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_342.wav|233|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_174.wav|233|It's that sort of night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_338.wav|233|Nobody else was with me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_081.wav|233|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_048.wav|233|It is all starting to come together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_013.wav|233|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_225.wav|233|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_155.wav|233|He will emerge as a world leader.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_363.wav|233|Safety was also an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_319.wav|233|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_296.wav|233|Sunday's game was not a trial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_282.wav|233|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_377.wav|233|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_141.wav|233|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_188.wav|233|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_231.wav|233|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_007.wav|233|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_321.wav|233|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_117.wav|233|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_267.wav|233|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_051.wav|233|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_098.wav|233|I cannot wait to get started on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_392.wav|233|He has not created a Festival resource.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_179.wav|233|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_386.wav|233|That set the tone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_209.wav|233|I have a cold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_045.wav|233|All businesses continue to trade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_273.wav|233|Immediate action must be taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_103.wav|233|Police said the family was helping with the search.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_335.wav|233|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_191.wav|233|There is no point in looking any further.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_158.wav|233|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_228.wav|233|Mental health is a massive issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_252.wav|233|A friendship that will endure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_064.wav|233|It was an amazing result.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_314.wav|233|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_122.wav|233|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_136.wav|233|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_300.wav|233|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_070.wav|233|This time, it might be for real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_246.wav|233|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_185.wav|233|I feel like my game has come a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_259.wav|233|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_290.wav|233|All options are open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_129.wav|233|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_153.wav|233|It would be a last resort.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_365.wav|233|But I managed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_015.wav|233|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_223.wav|233|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_237.wav|233|Broke the birdie record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_001.wav|233|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_371.wav|233|We shall not be moved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_147.wav|233|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_284.wav|233|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_020.wav|233|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_216.wav|233|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_166.wav|233|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_350.wav|233|However, it was well worth the wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_093.wav|233|He is in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_278.wav|233|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_087.wav|233|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_108.wav|233|In London today, it was business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_344.wav|233|His contract was then not renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_172.wav|233|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_312.wav|233|We have got no money to go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_254.wav|233|Her presence was almost everywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_062.wav|233|That is all in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_018.wav|233|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_368.wav|233|Colour was at the core of his life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_197.wav|233|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_183.wav|233|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_076.wav|233|We can all make a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_289.wav|233|He looked very sharp.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_240.wav|233|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_130.wav|233|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_306.wav|233|This is a war over our home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_261.wav|233|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_057.wav|233|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_327.wav|233|It added to the spectacle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_111.wav|233|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_105.wav|233|He has become a monster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_333.wav|233|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_043.wav|233|That means an extra two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_275.wav|233|It was an easy decision to come here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_039.wav|233|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_349.wav|233|Tyson is overwhelmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_343.wav|233|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_175.wav|233|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_033.wav|233|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_080.wav|233|On the night, it was not enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_049.wav|233|Part of the complex is historic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_339.wav|233|I've learned from my mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_094.wav|233|The Festival is prepared to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_027.wav|233|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_211.wav|233|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_161.wav|233|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_357.wav|233|Equity declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_283.wav|233|I feel pretty good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_230.wav|233|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_006.wav|233|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_376.wav|233|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_140.wav|233|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_189.wav|233|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_154.wav|233|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_362.wav|233|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_012.wav|233|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_224.wav|233|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_068.wav|233|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_297.wav|233|Who can predict?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_208.wav|233|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_178.wav|233|Waiting times for these services are too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_387.wav|233|It was a breathtaking moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_102.wav|233|It is much as it has been described.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_334.wav|233|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_044.wav|233|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_272.wav|233|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_266.wav|233|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_050.wav|233|The strategy is not without risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_099.wav|233|That is the fact of the matter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_320.wav|233|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_116.wav|233|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_071.wav|233|She did that for the rest of her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_247.wav|233|The salary changes are long overdue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_137.wav|233|I am now unemployed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_301.wav|233|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_184.wav|233|Is Saddam a threat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_229.wav|233|You have to do your research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_190.wav|233|I was totally wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_159.wav|233|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_315.wav|233|The problems began a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_123.wav|233|Who would be a referee?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_253.wav|233|This year I understood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_065.wav|233|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_370.wav|233|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_146.wav|233|It seems so long since I did the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_236.wav|233|I can't wait to meet him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_285.wav|233|It was a privilege to work for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_128.wav|233|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_258.wav|233|There will be tough opponents to this report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_291.wav|233|The attacker died in the crash.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_014.wav|233|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_222.wav|233|Work has started.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_152.wav|233|It is like a football team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_364.wav|233|They received a reply from their own managers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_109.wav|233|It is not affected by the sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_279.wav|233|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_086.wav|233|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_203.wav|233|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_345.wav|233|Eight months later, he was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_173.wav|233|I have got a wife to feed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_167.wav|233|Neither side can win this war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_351.wav|233|He agreed with my proposal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_021.wav|233|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_217.wav|233|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_092.wav|233|They have a further report to make in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_182.wav|233|He will feel the pain again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_131.wav|233|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_307.wav|233|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_077.wav|233|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_288.wav|233|They were too hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_241.wav|233|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_255.wav|233|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_063.wav|233|That could be a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_313.wav|233|The election is total confusion and chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_125.wav|233|That's all right then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_369.wav|233|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_196.wav|233|I had a train to catch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_019.wav|233|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_042.wav|233|He was in his element.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_274.wav|233|He is a young man with a new deal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_104.wav|233|She was there for the start of the campaign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_332.wav|233|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_348.wav|233|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_381.wav|233|It's just outrageous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_038.wav|233|Victory was never in doubt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_326.wav|233|Robert is a special talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_110.wav|233|We are currently working on the details.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_260.wav|233|I was happily surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_056.wav|233|This trend is likely to strengthen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_011.wav|233|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_157.wav|233|The home side didn't stand a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_361.wav|233|They have not done so this season so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_294.wav|233|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_249.wav|233|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_280.wav|233|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_139.wav|233|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_375.wav|233|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_143.wav|233|Is that it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_233.wav|233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_005.wav|233|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_097.wav|233|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_268.wav|233|Blood samples were taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_118.wav|233|It's not a new concept in jazz.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_162.wav|233|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_354.wav|233|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_024.wav|233|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_212.wav|233|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_030.wav|233|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_389.wav|233|What happened in the summer?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_340.wav|233|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_176.wav|233|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_083.wav|233|They were badly prepared for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_193.wav|233|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_299.wav|233|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_250.wav|233|There wasn't a goal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_066.wav|233|He has not been dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_316.wav|233|My body is clearly capable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_120.wav|233|I'm delighted about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_134.wav|233|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_302.wav|233|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_072.wav|233|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_244.wav|233|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_008.wav|233|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_187.wav|233|If that's the case, he will struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_378.wav|233|The mood was defiant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_323.wav|233|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_115.wav|233|We do not expect any surplus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_265.wav|233|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_053.wav|233|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_029.wav|233|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_359.wav|233|He could make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_390.wav|233|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_384.wav|233|That will come after the game on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_047.wav|233|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_271.wav|233|It looks as though he will be right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_101.wav|233|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_337.wav|233|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_022.wav|233|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_214.wav|233|That will be vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_164.wav|233|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_352.wav|233|Hartley should know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_328.wav|233|Who was the mystery MP?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_091.wav|233|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_058.wav|233|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_085.wav|233|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_346.wav|233|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_170.wav|233|I will tell you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_200.wav|233|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_292.wav|233|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_151.wav|233|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_198.wav|233|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_367.wav|233|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_017.wav|233|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_221.wav|233|The FBI could become involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_235.wav|233|But he failed to win the committee's support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_003.wav|233|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_373.wav|233|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_309.wav|233|We want to play at the worlds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_286.wav|233|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_079.wav|233|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_169.wav|233|It is so unfair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_263.wav|233|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_055.wav|233|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_325.wav|233|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_113.wav|233|The picture is the same across Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_107.wav|233|Everyone had to play the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_331.wav|233|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_041.wav|233|I have never been a member of the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_088.wav|233|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_277.wav|233|And Michael was just great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_382.wav|233|The road was closed for several hours.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_310.wav|233|This is the culture change in medicine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_126.wav|233|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_256.wav|233|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_060.wav|233|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_195.wav|233|It's a joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_181.wav|233|They thought they had found a home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_148.wav|233|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_238.wav|233|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_074.wav|233|We were under a bit of pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_242.wav|233|We were extremely poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_132.wav|233|He's been the key to everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_304.wav|233|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_138.wav|233|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_248.wav|233|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_281.wav|233|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_232.wav|233|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_004.wav|233|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_374.wav|233|He's a nice guy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_142.wav|233|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_156.wav|233|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_360.wav|233|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_226.wav|233|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_295.wav|233|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_388.wav|233|I was in jail for five years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_341.wav|233|The composer will conduct.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_177.wav|233|The release attracted little attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_082.wav|233|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_119.wav|233|My office is bare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_096.wav|233|I had a bit in hand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_269.wav|233|They are never here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_025.wav|233|We are a service industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_213.wav|233|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_163.wav|233|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_355.wav|233|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_073.wav|233|It starts with the script.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_245.wav|233|I know I'm in a very special position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_135.wav|233|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_303.wav|233|One was a lawyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_186.wav|233|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_379.wav|233|Yet the data is compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_009.wav|233|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_192.wav|233|I've been there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_317.wav|233|We are very strongly behind the bid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_121.wav|233|I joined a group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_298.wav|233|This is a huge confidence boost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_251.wav|233|It was a cry for help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_067.wav|233|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_385.wav|233|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_100.wav|233|It should be a condition of employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_336.wav|233|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_046.wav|233|The man became a reporter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_270.wav|233|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_264.wav|233|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_052.wav|233|I was released after six days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_322.wav|233|We agreed to disagree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_114.wav|233|It was the eighties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_358.wav|233|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_391.wav|233|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_028.wav|233|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_084.wav|233|It is not a story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_201.wav|233|He may need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_037.wav|233|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_347.wav|233|He had played well in that central role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_171.wav|233|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_165.wav|233|The attacker has been put in foster care.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_353.wav|233|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_023.wav|233|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_215.wav|233|We need to handle it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_090.wav|233|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_059.wav|233|There was no safety net.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_329.wav|233|He told the court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_144.wav|233|I saw some terrible things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_234.wav|233|My neighbours are horrified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_002.wav|233|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_308.wav|233|I was in daily contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_016.wav|233|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_220.wav|233|In each case they were a goal down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_150.wav|233|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_199.wav|233|However, this idea is never developed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_366.wav|233|They play together perfectly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_040.wav|233|We are the party of the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_089.wav|233|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_276.wav|233|It is the same in Sweden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_106.wav|233|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_330.wav|233|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_383.wav|233|It is unusual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_218.wav|233|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_168.wav|233|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_324.wav|233|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_112.wav|233|I thought it was a fantastic game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_262.wav|233|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_054.wav|233|We are working on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_239.wav|233|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_180.wav|233|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_149.wav|233|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_133.wav|233|It's an amazing landscape!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_305.wav|233|They should be swept away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_075.wav|233|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_243.wav|233|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_257.wav|233|I watched a game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_061.wav|233|You have to be patient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_311.wav|233|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_127.wav|233|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p233/p233_194.wav|233|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_261.wav|234|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_057.wav|234|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_327.wav|234|But it is important for a number of reasons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_111.wav|234|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_105.wav|234|He has become a monster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_333.wav|234|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_043.wav|234|That means an extra two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_275.wav|234|The statement contained no surprises.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_039.wav|234|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_349.wav|234|We are not interested in dividends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_312.wav|234|And we can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_124.wav|234|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_254.wav|234|From there, they can go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_062.wav|234|That is all in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_018.wav|234|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_197.wav|234|He has defended the system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_183.wav|234|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_076.wav|234|We can all make a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_240.wav|234|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_289.wav|234|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_130.wav|234|We are committed to the ban.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_306.wav|234|They are not going the length of the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_020.wav|234|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_216.wav|234|It was a management problem in the hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_166.wav|234|At the moment we do not understand it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_350.wav|234|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_093.wav|234|He is in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_278.wav|234|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_087.wav|234|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_108.wav|234|In London today, it was business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_344.wav|234|We do not have the papers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_172.wav|234|I have had a good life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_202.wav|234|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_034.wav|234|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_290.wav|234|The party has never fully recovered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_259.wav|234|It was a great experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_129.wav|234|Three days later, he was killed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_153.wav|234|That is the nature of the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_015.wav|234|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_223.wav|234|He must have a crack at it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_237.wav|234|But we are not immune to the problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_001.wav|234|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_147.wav|234|She does not want to speak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_284.wav|234|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_158.wav|234|The players were under pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_191.wav|234|It is not in the public interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_228.wav|234|Mr Blair was ready for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_252.wav|234|It was far from business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_064.wav|234|It was an amazing result.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_314.wav|234|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_122.wav|234|That admission is not surprising.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_136.wav|234|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_300.wav|234|And it was this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_070.wav|234|This time, it might be for real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_246.wav|234|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_185.wav|234|He called for a public inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_321.wav|234|You have to count on other people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_117.wav|234|And we had a good response.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_267.wav|234|We can certainly build on this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_098.wav|234|I cannot wait to get started on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_051.wav|234|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_179.wav|234|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_209.wav|234|I will be in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_045.wav|234|All businesses continue to trade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_273.wav|234|Clearly, the stakes are high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_103.wav|234|Police said the family was helping with the search.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_335.wav|234|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_013.wav|234|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_225.wav|234|Her experience is certainly limited.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_155.wav|234|We want to get there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_319.wav|234|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_069.wav|234|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_296.wav|234|The results are expected within days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_282.wav|234|My view has always been the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_188.wav|234|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_141.wav|234|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_231.wav|234|He is a good friend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_007.wav|234|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_095.wav|234|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_160.wav|234|There is no common ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_356.wav|234|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_026.wav|234|But we will have to wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_210.wav|234|It was the story of the second half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_204.wav|234|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_032.wav|234|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_342.wav|234|We did something about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_174.wav|234|That was the difference between the sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_338.wav|234|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_048.wav|234|It is all starting to come together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_081.wav|234|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_042.wav|234|He was in his element.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_274.wav|234|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_104.wav|234|She was there for the start of the campaign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_332.wav|234|But it can be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_348.wav|234|The answer was in space.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_038.wav|234|Victory was never in doubt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_326.wav|234|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_110.wav|234|We are currently working on the details.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_260.wav|234|They are difficult awards to decide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_056.wav|234|This trend is likely to strengthen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_182.wav|234|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_131.wav|234|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_307.wav|234|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_077.wav|234|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_241.wav|234|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_288.wav|234|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_255.wav|234|The world is a good place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_063.wav|234|That could be a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_313.wav|234|Every one is a winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_125.wav|234|There was a lot of resentment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_196.wav|234|Clearly, they had other problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_019.wav|234|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_109.wav|234|It is not affected by the sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_279.wav|234|However, no further action was taken by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_086.wav|234|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_203.wav|234|We can take the city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_035.wav|234|History is in the making.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_345.wav|234|However, the devil is in the detail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_173.wav|234|Three hours later, the man was free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_167.wav|234|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_351.wav|234|His concern is only for the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_021.wav|234|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_217.wav|234|Being investor ready is a good start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_092.wav|234|They have a further report to make in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_146.wav|234|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_236.wav|234|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_285.wav|234|Do you think we're a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_128.wav|234|The end result is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_291.wav|234|In many ways, that is as important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_258.wav|234|I am delighted for them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_014.wav|234|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_222.wav|234|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_152.wav|234|But it is different in different regions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_071.wav|234|She did that for the rest of her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_247.wav|234|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_137.wav|234|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_301.wav|234|But that's another story for another day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_184.wav|234|They were not seeking the right to strike.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_229.wav|234|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_159.wav|234|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_190.wav|234|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_315.wav|234|They have set the standard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_123.wav|234|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_253.wav|234|It was just another play.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_065.wav|234|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_208.wav|234|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_178.wav|234|I was always in control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_102.wav|234|It is much as it has been described.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_334.wav|234|We have to be very, very careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_044.wav|234|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_272.wav|234|We want this place to work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_266.wav|234|Not in this production he doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_099.wav|234|That is the fact of the matter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_050.wav|234|The strategy is not without risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_320.wav|234|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_116.wav|234|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_283.wav|234|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_230.wav|234|He intends to restart in the spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_006.wav|234|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_189.wav|234|It is simply not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_140.wav|234|Actors like to be in the centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_154.wav|234|There is a spring in the step.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_012.wav|234|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_224.wav|234|The force is with them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_068.wav|234|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_297.wav|234|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_318.wav|234|The existing structure is in trouble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_343.wav|234|The market is the market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_175.wav|234|They have not been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_205.wav|234|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_033.wav|234|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_049.wav|234|Part of the complex is historic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_080.wav|234|On the night, it was not enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_339.wav|234|I think the overall picture is still strong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_094.wav|234|The Festival is prepared to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_027.wav|234|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_211.wav|234|The trading conditions are not good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_161.wav|234|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_357.wav|234|The City welcomed the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_310.wav|234|Scotland won by six wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_126.wav|234|He wanted to record the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_256.wav|234|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_060.wav|234|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_195.wav|234|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_148.wav|234|It is expected to last a week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_181.wav|234|He was asked to quit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_238.wav|234|I was not overly concerned about this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_074.wav|234|We were under a bit of pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_242.wav|234|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_132.wav|234|The problem was a social problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_304.wav|234|We're looking for unity in the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_169.wav|234|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_219.wav|234|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_263.wav|234|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_055.wav|234|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_325.wav|234|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_113.wav|234|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_107.wav|234|Everyone had to play the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_331.wav|234|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_088.wav|234|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_041.wav|234|I have never been a member of the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_277.wav|234|That would be a danger.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_292.wav|234|His leader wanted to celebrate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_198.wav|234|If that's the case, he will struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_151.wav|234|As for the warning, it was not needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_017.wav|234|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_221.wav|234|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_235.wav|234|The conference is the first test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_003.wav|234|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_145.wav|234|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_309.wav|234|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_286.wav|234|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_079.wav|234|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_022.wav|234|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_214.wav|234|This is an interesting link.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_164.wav|234|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_352.wav|234|And it's a goodbye from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_328.wav|234|All of the management has invested in the firm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_058.wav|234|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_091.wav|234|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_085.wav|234|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_346.wav|234|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_170.wav|234|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_200.wav|234|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_036.wav|234|It was sold at a loss.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_323.wav|234|And he's the real thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_115.wav|234|She is not a victim.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_265.wav|234|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_053.wav|234|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_029.wav|234|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_359.wav|234|There's still a bit to go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_047.wav|234|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_271.wav|234|Well, it was certainly different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_101.wav|234|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_337.wav|234|Hopefully, this week will be good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_193.wav|234|The performance is not there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_250.wav|234|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_299.wav|234|We were well worth the win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_066.wav|234|He has not been dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_316.wav|234|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_120.wav|234|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_134.wav|234|It is not so simple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_302.wav|234|But it was also hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_072.wav|234|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_244.wav|234|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_008.wav|234|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_187.wav|234|As, indeed, they would be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_097.wav|234|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_268.wav|234|Then was the summer of their discontent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_118.wav|234|When we looked at the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_162.wav|234|In that case, the children were not missing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_354.wav|234|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_024.wav|234|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_212.wav|234|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_030.wav|234|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_340.wav|234|That is always a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_176.wav|234|I was in a hole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_083.wav|234|They were badly prepared for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_227.wav|234|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_157.wav|234|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_361.wav|234|We never played at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_294.wav|234|Of further privacy, he had no need.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_280.wav|234|It depends on Labour, not on us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_249.wav|234|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_139.wav|234|Are you from the rugby?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_143.wav|234|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_233.wav|234|But it may not be all bad news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_005.wav|234|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_239.wav|234|However, it is not as simple as this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_149.wav|234|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_180.wav|234|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_133.wav|234|He had no money left to run the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_305.wav|234|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_075.wav|234|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_243.wav|234|Was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_257.wav|234|The matter is under appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_061.wav|234|You have to be patient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_311.wav|234|It has to be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_127.wav|234|However, it was a different story in the final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_194.wav|234|It would make a lot of sense.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_089.wav|234|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_040.wav|234|We are the party of the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_276.wav|234|The performance continues to improve.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_106.wav|234|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_330.wav|234|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_218.wav|234|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_168.wav|234|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_324.wav|234|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_112.wav|234|That would be a serious problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_262.wav|234|His second was a beauty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_054.wav|234|We are working on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_144.wav|234|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_234.wav|234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_002.wav|234|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_287.wav|234|How independent is that?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_308.wav|234|The concerns are the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_293.wav|234|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_016.wav|234|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_220.wav|234|This conference was never confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_199.wav|234|I could not sit in the stands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_150.wav|234|It is too pretty, it is too small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_084.wav|234|It is not a story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_201.wav|234|They have to get that sorted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_037.wav|234|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_347.wav|234|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_171.wav|234|Much of the equipment was new.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_165.wav|234|Anyone can do the sums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_353.wav|234|They have to be addressed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_023.wav|234|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_059.wav|234|There was no safety net.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_090.wav|234|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_329.wav|234|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_100.wav|234|It should be a condition of employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_336.wav|234|This could be a mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_046.wav|234|The man became a reporter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_270.wav|234|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_264.wav|234|Scotland played a major part in the project.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_052.wav|234|I was released after six days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_322.wav|234|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_114.wav|234|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_358.wav|234|Something is going to have to give.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_028.wav|234|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_073.wav|234|It starts with the script.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_245.wav|234|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_135.wav|234|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_303.wav|234|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_186.wav|234|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_009.wav|234|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_192.wav|234|Well, this article is a bit like that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_317.wav|234|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_121.wav|234|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_251.wav|234|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_298.wav|234|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_067.wav|234|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_341.wav|234|We will deliver at director level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_177.wav|234|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_207.wav|234|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_031.wav|234|It is on the internet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_082.wav|234|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_119.wav|234|No, the equipment is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_096.wav|234|I had a bit in hand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_269.wav|234|There is a world of difference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_025.wav|234|We are a service industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_213.wav|234|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_163.wav|234|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_355.wav|234|However, a bid was never made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_138.wav|234|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_281.wav|234|I had to be into it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_248.wav|234|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_232.wav|234|It is the strength of the school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_004.wav|234|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_142.wav|234|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_156.wav|234|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_360.wav|234|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_010.wav|234|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_226.wav|234|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p234/p234_295.wav|234|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_486.wav|236|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_165.wav|236|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_353.wav|236|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_023.wav|236|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_215.wav|236|Tommy is not a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_059.wav|236|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_090.wav|236|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_435.wav|236|But we have built a platform for next season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_329.wav|236|I am not obsessed with sex.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_421.wav|236|He will be judged by his actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_084.wav|236|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_201.wav|236|It shows the strength of the roots.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_037.wav|236|It carried a double message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_347.wav|236|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_492.wav|236|The BBC was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_400.wav|236|It certainly appeared that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_293.wav|236|Stephen will get his first cap.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_016.wav|236|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_220.wav|236|You are a great player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_199.wav|236|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_366.wav|236|It's as wide as a church in here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_372.wav|236|We used to keep our business rates.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_144.wav|236|Like the others, he was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_234.wav|236|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_002.wav|236|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_287.wav|236|Blair also had a penalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_078.wav|236|He was just a journalist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_308.wav|236|I was there five months ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_414.wav|236|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_218.wav|236|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_397.wav|236|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_442.wav|236|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_168.wav|236|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_324.wav|236|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_438.wav|236|I chose to make a film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_112.wav|236|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_262.wav|236|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_054.wav|236|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_089.wav|236|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_040.wav|236|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_276.wav|236|We accept the new rules.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_330.wav|236|I didn't have the reply.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_456.wav|236|They were not even allowed to see them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_383.wav|236|A review is under way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_257.wav|236|I was just a kid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_061.wav|236|The tournament has now been cancelled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_311.wav|236|We can work all night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_127.wav|236|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_194.wav|236|I had too much to drink.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_477.wav|236|Analysts said the offer was fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_239.wav|236|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_149.wav|236|I was shaking on the blocks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_463.wav|236|Not if you know the person.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_180.wav|236|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_133.wav|236|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_419.wav|236|They were not complacent in any way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_305.wav|236|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_075.wav|236|The Festival is prepared to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_243.wav|236|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_156.wav|236|It was a funny feeling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_360.wav|236|They have broken that promise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_010.wav|236|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_226.wav|236|There was a lot of resentment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_295.wav|236|And that match was played in June.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_406.wav|236|It had been on the cards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_412.wav|236|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_138.wav|236|It was a piece of art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_281.wav|236|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_232.wav|236|I'm just a regular person.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_004.wav|236|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_374.wav|236|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_468.wav|236|The bill would be massive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_142.wav|236|It has become a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_119.wav|236|Which can happen any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_433.wav|236|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_096.wav|236|He refused to name the survivors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_269.wav|236|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_025.wav|236|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_213.wav|236|The service from the other players was super.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_480.wav|236|It is a vicious circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_163.wav|236|Seven people were later detained by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_449.wav|236|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_355.wav|236|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_341.wav|236|Finally, he paid for the movie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_388.wav|236|It brought in new management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_177.wav|236|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_494.wav|236|It was still there, but right at the end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_207.wav|236|My duty is to win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_031.wav|236|He was jailed for four years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_427.wav|236|It is a case of pity for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_192.wav|236|I have spoken to head office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_471.wav|236|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_317.wav|236|That is the real test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_121.wav|236|He is a lovely man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_251.wav|236|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_298.wav|236|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_073.wav|236|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_245.wav|236|Truth is the child of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_135.wav|236|I enjoy the creative process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_303.wav|236|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_465.wav|236|I was all image and no substance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_186.wav|236|City sentiment is in his favour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_379.wav|236|The seller was not revealed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_009.wav|236|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_264.wav|236|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_052.wav|236|That was the difference today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_322.wav|236|I can live with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_114.wav|236|The hearing was due to continue today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_391.wav|236|The following day I used the story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_358.wav|236|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_444.wav|236|I know the worry over Iraq.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_502.wav|236|I stayed away from the defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_028.wav|236|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_450.wav|236|We are going for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_499.wav|236|In fact, we were all over the shop.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_385.wav|236|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_100.wav|236|Our house was very small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_336.wav|236|That decision has already been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_046.wav|236|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_270.wav|236|But they were never expected to last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_085.wav|236|Change will however have to be in euros.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_420.wav|236|They did the right thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_346.wav|236|It's a policy which has worked for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_170.wav|236|That is not the case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_493.wav|236|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_200.wav|236|I had a train to catch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_036.wav|236|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_214.wav|236|The early physical reports were clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_487.wav|236|We have to go for a win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_164.wav|236|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_352.wav|236|Alex Ferguson is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_434.wav|236|But you can go beyond that condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_328.wav|236|After some discussion they did.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_058.wav|236|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_091.wav|236|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_235.wav|236|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_003.wav|236|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_373.wav|236|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_145.wav|236|We will provide immediate access.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_309.wav|236|I am a retailer by nature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_415.wav|236|I've got my own ideas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_286.wav|236|Much of the equipment was new.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_079.wav|236|On Saturday, it was much the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_292.wav|236|She failed in her action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_401.wav|236|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_198.wav|236|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_151.wav|236|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_367.wav|236|The work with Alison was a great experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_017.wav|236|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_221.wav|236|I won't make an official complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_107.wav|236|They will notice a difference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_331.wav|236|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_088.wav|236|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_041.wav|236|I needed a change, a new challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_277.wav|236|We run within the law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_457.wav|236|And she is very clear on this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_382.wav|236|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_396.wav|236|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_443.wav|236|We would have concerns about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_169.wav|236|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_219.wav|236|You have caught a serial killer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_263.wav|236|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_055.wav|236|We felt it was sufficient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_325.wav|236|The law will take its course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_439.wav|236|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_113.wav|236|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_148.wav|236|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_462.wav|236|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_181.wav|236|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_238.wav|236|This will secure the future of our industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_074.wav|236|We did it for the jersey.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_242.wav|236|You have to do your research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_132.wav|236|They could use a boost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_418.wav|236|I think it's a miracle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_304.wav|236|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_310.wav|236|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_126.wav|236|He said to give a local injection.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_256.wav|236|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_060.wav|236|I have proved that in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_195.wav|236|As many as the market will support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_476.wav|236|I am a committed European.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_280.wav|236|It has all been done in secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_249.wav|236|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_413.wav|236|He is on the wrong side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_139.wav|236|That view has not altered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_375.wav|236|Everyone could see the joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_469.wav|236|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_143.wav|236|The whole industry is a shambles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_233.wav|236|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_005.wav|236|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_011.wav|236|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_227.wav|236|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_157.wav|236|I'm afraid to say anything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_361.wav|236|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_407.wav|236|He seems to be used to the attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_294.wav|236|The partnership was set up during the summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_206.wav|236|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_030.wav|236|And we have a singer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_340.wav|236|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_389.wav|236|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_176.wav|236|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_495.wav|236|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_426.wav|236|Everything in golf is a balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_083.wav|236|The Queen Mother is dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_097.wav|236|That time is not now, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_268.wav|236|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_118.wav|236|Three hours later, the man was free.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_432.wav|236|Paris is not only young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_481.wav|236|He will be advised by me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_162.wav|236|I have got a wife to feed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_448.wav|236|No options are excluded at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_354.wav|236|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_024.wav|236|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_212.wav|236|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_134.wav|236|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_302.wav|236|It's all designed to speed up the service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_072.wav|236|These people are not big names.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_244.wav|236|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_464.wav|236|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_187.wav|236|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_378.wav|236|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_193.wav|236|Says the Duke of York.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_470.wav|236|Neither woman has been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_250.wav|236|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_299.wav|236|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_066.wav|236|Both men were on one-year contracts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_316.wav|236|These figures are truly awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_120.wav|236|The colours are very pretty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_451.wav|236|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_498.wav|236|I was ready for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_384.wav|236|They know it'll be fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_047.wav|236|Everything else is a bonus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_271.wav|236|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_101.wav|236|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_337.wav|236|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_323.wav|236|A lot has been written.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_115.wav|236|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_265.wav|236|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_053.wav|236|We keep an eye on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_503.wav|236|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_029.wav|236|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_390.wav|236|She is in their hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_359.wav|236|Scotland is the home of golf.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_445.wav|236|Taxes may need to rise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_402.wav|236|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_128.wav|236|You are a gambling man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_291.wav|236|My body is a wreck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_258.wav|236|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_014.wav|236|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_222.wav|236|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_478.wav|236|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_152.wav|236|It would seem a natural progression.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_364.wav|236|She said they would appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_370.wav|236|They will fight for everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_146.wav|236|He could do nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_236.wav|236|I am considered a teenager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_285.wav|236|They can leave at any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_416.wav|236|I never had a childhood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_484.wav|236|That is the bottom line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_167.wav|236|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_351.wav|236|He had no previous convictions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_398.wav|236|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_021.wav|236|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_217.wav|236|John Daly has a burning ambition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_092.wav|236|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_437.wav|236|He said current trading was strong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_109.wav|236|New Year will be very busy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_423.wav|236|It is an absolute nonsense.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_279.wav|236|He took over our lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_086.wav|236|It was a big departure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_203.wav|236|This youngster is so exciting!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_035.wav|236|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_345.wav|236|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_173.wav|236|They could not match it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_490.wav|236|I had it before the final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_459.wav|236|Dennis was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_255.wav|236|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_063.wav|236|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_313.wav|236|It was an excellent performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_125.wav|236|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_369.wav|236|We are a Scottish company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_196.wav|236|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_475.wav|236|I could feel the blood on my face.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_019.wav|236|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_461.wav|236|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_182.wav|236|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_131.wav|236|We will try to find someone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_307.wav|236|The rescue package is public money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_077.wav|236|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_241.wav|236|They said that they stood by their statement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_288.wav|236|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_395.wav|236|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_440.wav|236|But by that time, it was too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_489.wav|236|Something has got to change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_326.wav|236|This is a historic occasion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_110.wav|236|There's still plenty time left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_260.wav|236|It is very hard for her.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_056.wav|236|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_042.wav|236|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_274.wav|236|He will go on the bench.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_104.wav|236|It is a total and utter change of culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_332.wav|236|These days will be back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_454.wav|236|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_381.wav|236|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_348.wav|236|The confidence isn't there now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_038.wav|236|That means an extra two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_431.wav|236|It was that bad, that low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_094.wav|236|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_027.wav|236|Meetings will also remain private.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_211.wav|236|This will be our new beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_482.wav|236|Winning a medal is a dream.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_161.wav|236|It is not a financial issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_357.wav|236|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_343.wav|236|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_175.wav|236|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_496.wav|236|They never gave up hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_205.wav|236|It caused a lot of upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_033.wav|236|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_049.wav|236|This is the interesting part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_080.wav|236|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_339.wav|236|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_425.wav|236|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_154.wav|236|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_362.wav|236|It's only a matter of scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_012.wav|236|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_224.wav|236|Which isn't a bad idea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_068.wav|236|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_297.wav|236|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_404.wav|236|I remain a buyer of the shares.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_318.wav|236|They have to be addressed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_410.wav|236|He may have a point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_283.wav|236|She always wanted her own way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_230.wav|236|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_006.wav|236|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_376.wav|236|All would be under threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_189.wav|236|Tomorrow is a new day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_140.wav|236|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_266.wav|236|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_099.wav|236|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_050.wav|236|I haven't been ill at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_320.wav|236|Cast Away now on general release.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_116.wav|236|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_393.wav|236|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_446.wav|236|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_500.wav|236|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_208.wav|236|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_452.wav|236|It is a cause for concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_178.wav|236|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_387.wav|236|Motion described it as a unique event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_428.wav|236|I believe the gap is nearly there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_102.wav|236|It became difficult for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_044.wav|236|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_272.wav|236|The capital costs are modest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_229.wav|236|Death is outside the language.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_159.wav|236|It's not like us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_190.wav|236|It makes no influence on the public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_473.wav|236|They make a selective perception process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_315.wav|236|And we can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_123.wav|236|I was on a roll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_409.wav|236|I would love to think that she could win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_253.wav|236|Pensions are a long-term investment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_065.wav|236|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_071.wav|236|It looks like a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_247.wav|236|Was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_137.wav|236|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_301.wav|236|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_467.wav|236|It can all be done over the phone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_184.wav|236|The Hibs manager is no fool.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_237.wav|236|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_371.wav|236|The pair are very much in love.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_147.wav|236|We have a clean bill of health.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_417.wav|236|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_284.wav|236|I realised I was lucky to have it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_290.wav|236|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_259.wav|236|It was quite a new prescription.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_403.wav|236|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_129.wav|236|Before it was an ordeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_479.wav|236|Then came the farewell to Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_153.wav|236|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_365.wav|236|There is no deal as yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_015.wav|236|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_223.wav|236|They are looking at a flotation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_278.wav|236|We have the moral high ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_087.wav|236|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_108.wav|236|Football is a passion for many.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_422.wav|236|The fate of the rest is unknown.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_344.wav|236|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_172.wav|236|It's nice to be nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_491.wav|236|Our fans have been marvellous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_458.wav|236|And it covers the spectrum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_202.wav|236|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_034.wav|236|He works at the airport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_020.wav|236|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_216.wav|236|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_485.wav|236|It happens on an annual basis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_166.wav|236|He is not a team captain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_350.wav|236|A great deal has been achieved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_399.wav|236|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_436.wav|236|It looked like a war zone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_093.wav|236|It is open season on the Old Firm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_460.wav|236|The chief constable has retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_183.wav|236|I feel like my game has come a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_076.wav|236|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_240.wav|236|People should make their own decisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_289.wav|236|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_130.wav|236|I love the spectacle of cinema.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_306.wav|236|Maloney is an engaging talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_312.wav|236|It was really very frightening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_124.wav|236|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_254.wav|236|Those overseas offices were great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_062.wav|236|I was very pleased with them today, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_018.wav|236|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_368.wav|236|It was like a weekly wage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_197.wav|236|That is a waste of energy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_474.wav|236|He was a shooting star.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_105.wav|236|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_333.wav|236|You may have a short memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_043.wav|236|Their campaign is in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_275.wav|236|That could be in place by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_039.wav|236|That was the case with David.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_455.wav|236|He deserved a red card.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_380.wav|236|People are on the alert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_349.wav|236|We put our bid in last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_394.wav|236|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_441.wav|236|The damage is all inside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_488.wav|236|It worked well in Monaco.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_261.wav|236|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_057.wav|236|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_327.wav|236|This ruling is a farce.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_111.wav|236|The result is a vacuum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_204.wav|236|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_032.wav|236|He should emerge as the winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_342.wav|236|It was almost too much.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_174.wav|236|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_497.wav|236|He had planned to sell it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_338.wav|236|The game is now open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_424.wav|236|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_048.wav|236|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_081.wav|236|We have turned the corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_095.wav|236|I had a ball today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_430.wav|236|We've got a good management record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_483.wav|236|We had to add value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_356.wav|236|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_026.wav|236|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_210.wav|236|No details of the talks were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_282.wav|236|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_411.wav|236|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_377.wav|236|I understand the frustration of the fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_188.wav|236|We are the gateway to justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_141.wav|236|So I got a blood test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_231.wav|236|The course has helped a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_007.wav|236|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_013.wav|236|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_225.wav|236|There is no quick fix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_155.wav|236|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_363.wav|236|We must put a marker down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_405.wav|236|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_319.wav|236|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_069.wav|236|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_296.wav|236|I saw it at a ruck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_453.wav|236|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_179.wav|236|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_386.wav|236|Clark is back on top form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_209.wav|236|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_045.wav|236|We are working on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_273.wav|236|I told you I was ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_429.wav|236|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_103.wav|236|It's not a lack of effort.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_335.wav|236|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_321.wav|236|All winners should be tested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_117.wav|236|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_267.wav|236|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_098.wav|236|We created so many chances.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_051.wav|236|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_501.wav|236|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_392.wav|236|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_447.wav|236|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_136.wav|236|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_300.wav|236|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_070.wav|236|He was seen as the enemy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_246.wav|236|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_466.wav|236|The boys are mentally focused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_185.wav|236|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_158.wav|236|We did what we had to do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_191.wav|236|Each case is treated on merit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_472.wav|236|We live by the rule of law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_228.wav|236|From there, they can go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_252.wav|236|It's important to get it right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_064.wav|236|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_314.wav|236|The answer is with ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_122.wav|236|Becoming a father was wonderful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p236/p236_408.wav|236|The trick is to try it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_069.wav|237|It is like a river running by my home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_296.wav|237|I intended to look for another club on loan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_155.wav|237|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_013.wav|237|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_225.wav|237|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_231.wav|237|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_007.wav|237|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_188.wav|237|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_141.wav|237|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_282.wav|237|This is a question of Islam.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_026.wav|237|They should be so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_210.wav|237|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_160.wav|237|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_095.wav|237|Until you hit the big games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_048.wav|237|I feel pretty good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_081.wav|237|It's all going to clear the debt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_338.wav|237|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_342.wav|237|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_174.wav|237|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_204.wav|237|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_032.wav|237|There's a story, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_314.wav|237|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_122.wav|237|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_252.wav|237|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_064.wav|237|You do not change overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_228.wav|237|William Hague delighted his party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_191.wav|237|It's a joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_185.wav|237|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_070.wav|237|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_246.wav|237|They should come forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_136.wav|237|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_300.wav|237|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_267.wav|237|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_098.wav|237|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_051.wav|237|That should do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_321.wav|237|I never thought it would take this long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_117.wav|237|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_103.wav|237|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_335.wav|237|He can do no wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_045.wav|237|It is so sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_273.wav|237|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_179.wav|237|He was a crazy man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_093.wav|237|We must look forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_166.wav|237|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_350.wav|237|The composer will conduct.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_020.wav|237|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_216.wav|237|It is a gamble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_202.wav|237|Our strategy is straightforward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_034.wav|237|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_344.wav|237|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_172.wav|237|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_108.wav|237|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_278.wav|237|The warning is timely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_087.wav|237|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_015.wav|237|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_223.wav|237|The FBI could become involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_153.wav|237|He will emerge as a world leader.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_129.wav|237|She really suffered for her art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_290.wav|237|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_259.wav|237|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_284.wav|237|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_147.wav|237|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_237.wav|237|They are the innocent victims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_001.wav|237|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_327.wav|237|The parents will have a great time, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_111.wav|237|It's in his blood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_057.wav|237|I was inspired by two things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_349.wav|237|Nobody else was with me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_039.wav|237|The problem is the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_043.wav|237|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_275.wav|237|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_105.wav|237|I didn't play well last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_333.wav|237|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_018.wav|237|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_254.wav|237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_062.wav|237|None has ever been found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_312.wav|237|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_124.wav|237|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_130.wav|237|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_306.wav|237|I was the sheep.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_076.wav|237|The price cuts are really exciting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_240.wav|237|You take a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_289.wav|237|She failed in her action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_183.wav|237|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_189.wav|237|Four policemen were wounded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_140.wav|237|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_230.wav|237|Clearly, the stakes are high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_006.wav|237|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_283.wav|237|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_318.wav|237|We want to play at the worlds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_068.wav|237|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_297.wav|237|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_012.wav|237|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_224.wav|237|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_154.wav|237|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_339.wav|237|They haven't got a hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_049.wav|237|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_080.wav|237|It may well have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_205.wav|237|Tommy is not a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_033.wav|237|This is the window.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_343.wav|237|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_175.wav|237|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_161.wav|237|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_027.wav|237|I have a theory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_211.wav|237|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_094.wav|237|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_184.wav|237|This is a sad day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_137.wav|237|It's perfectly feasible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_301.wav|237|That could change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_071.wav|237|Try to save us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_247.wav|237|It is not the message alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_253.wav|237|We were extremely poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_065.wav|237|Art is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_315.wav|237|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_123.wav|237|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_159.wav|237|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_190.wav|237|They receive a high profile in the media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_229.wav|237|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_044.wav|237|It's the only thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_272.wav|237|This is a big club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_102.wav|237|But it was a pleasure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_334.wav|237|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_178.wav|237|Waiting times for these services are too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_208.wav|237|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_320.wav|237|They were fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_266.wav|237|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_099.wav|237|By that time, however, it was already too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_050.wav|237|It is bizarre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_345.wav|237|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_173.wav|237|He is keen to stay in public service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_203.wav|237|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_035.wav|237|I'd like to continue that record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_279.wav|237|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_086.wav|237|It's never too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_109.wav|237|It is normal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_092.wav|237|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_021.wav|237|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_217.wav|237|He is slightly confused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_167.wav|237|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_351.wav|237|It should be scrapped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_285.wav|237|Immediate action must be taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_236.wav|237|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_146.wav|237|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_014.wav|237|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_222.wav|237|By hard work, is the answer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_291.wav|237|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_258.wav|237|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_128.wav|237|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_038.wav|237|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_348.wav|237|Look at the witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_104.wav|237|We want to get to the final, anyway.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_332.wav|237|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_042.wav|237|This film will be totally awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_274.wav|237|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_260.wav|237|Our decision making was poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_056.wav|237|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_326.wav|237|In the old days, it was easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_110.wav|237|Further protests are likely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_077.wav|237|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_241.wav|237|They tried to give her advice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_288.wav|237|You know the type.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_131.wav|237|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_307.wav|237|Graeme was prepared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_182.wav|237|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_019.wav|237|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_196.wav|237|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_313.wav|237|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_125.wav|237|But it took a lot of bottle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_255.wav|237|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_063.wav|237|It's a real challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_024.wav|237|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_212.wav|237|I don't want to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_162.wav|237|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_118.wav|237|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_097.wav|237|I love the Dome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_268.wav|237|That could be in place by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_083.wav|237|He is driven.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_340.wav|237|It has moved on in the last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_176.wav|237|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_206.wav|237|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_030.wav|237|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_294.wav|237|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_157.wav|237|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_011.wav|237|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_227.wav|237|You have to do your research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_233.wav|237|I'd never seen a play about me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_005.wav|237|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_143.wav|237|Three penalties were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_139.wav|237|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_280.wav|237|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_249.wav|237|He says that he is no different from any other man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_029.wav|237|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_265.wav|237|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_053.wav|237|She looked so young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_323.wav|237|It should be equal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_101.wav|237|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_337.wav|237|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_047.wav|237|It is urgent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_271.wav|237|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_316.wav|237|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_120.wav|237|Does this mean.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_250.wav|237|It's quite a line-up !
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_299.wav|237|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_066.wav|237|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_193.wav|237|I wish I could say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_187.wav|237|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_008.wav|237|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_072.wav|237|The end result is precisely the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_244.wav|237|We are in the hat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_134.wav|237|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_302.wav|237|He should have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_017.wav|237|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_221.wav|237|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_198.wav|237|If the director is with you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_151.wav|237|The idea is simple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_292.wav|237|They seem to get away with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_286.wav|237|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_079.wav|237|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_309.wav|237|It is a road of death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_145.wav|237|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_235.wav|237|I can't wait to meet him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_003.wav|237|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_058.wav|237|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_091.wav|237|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_328.wav|237|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_164.wav|237|I was in daily contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_214.wav|237|There was an e-mail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_200.wav|237|It is a case of taking a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_036.wav|237|They're just different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_346.wav|237|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_170.wav|237|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_085.wav|237|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_195.wav|237|I've got good news and bad news for you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_256.wav|237|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_060.wav|237|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_310.wav|237|This is a war over our home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_126.wav|237|I thought it was a fantastic game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_132.wav|237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_304.wav|237|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_074.wav|237|Painful, but only because it's true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_242.wav|237|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_238.wav|237|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_148.wav|237|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_181.wav|237|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_325.wav|237|We are very strongly behind the bid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_113.wav|237|It's a shame.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_263.wav|237|They are different types.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_055.wav|237|Life is good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_219.wav|237|I began to pray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_169.wav|237|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_088.wav|237|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_041.wav|237|He did not know his daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_277.wav|237|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_107.wav|237|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_331.wav|237|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_082.wav|237|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_207.wav|237|He was also married with two children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_031.wav|237|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_341.wav|237|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_177.wav|237|The release attracted little attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_163.wav|237|We are now up against it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_025.wav|237|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_213.wav|237|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_096.wav|237|We could not get any possession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_119.wav|237|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_142.wav|237|He has the edge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_232.wav|237|I am immensely sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_004.wav|237|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_281.wav|237|There is no link.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_248.wav|237|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_138.wav|237|They took a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_295.wav|237|I saw it at a ruck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_010.wav|237|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_226.wav|237|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_156.wav|237|It is huge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_046.wav|237|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_270.wav|237|Special measures were needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_100.wav|237|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_028.wav|237|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_322.wav|237|They wanted the club to make money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_114.wav|237|I came to complete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_264.wav|237|There's the mix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_052.wav|237|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_009.wav|237|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_186.wav|237|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_135.wav|237|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_303.wav|237|Who can predict?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_073.wav|237|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_245.wav|237|Of course, that is not the whole story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_251.wav|237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_298.wav|237|Holland won by five wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_067.wav|237|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_317.wav|237|It is no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_121.wav|237|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_192.wav|237|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_308.wav|237|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_287.wav|237|We're in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_078.wav|237|It is a terrible place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_234.wav|237|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_002.wav|237|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_144.wav|237|It seems so long since I did the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_199.wav|237|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_150.wav|237|Is that Titanic?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_016.wav|237|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_220.wav|237|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_293.wav|237|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_347.wav|237|Indeed, it was magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_171.wav|237|I was in the train station overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_201.wav|237|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_037.wav|237|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_084.wav|237|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_329.wav|237|I am so upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_059.wav|237|We were surprised to see the photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_090.wav|237|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_023.wav|237|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_215.wav|237|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_165.wav|237|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_075.wav|237|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_243.wav|237|It's a dead end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_133.wav|237|Who will attend?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_305.wav|237|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_149.wav|237|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_180.wav|237|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_239.wav|237|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_194.wav|237|It is tough, but possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_311.wav|237|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_127.wav|237|I'm so angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_257.wav|237|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_061.wav|237|I've had six days of rehearsal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_106.wav|237|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_330.wav|237|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_089.wav|237|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_040.wav|237|It's a great thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_276.wav|237|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_262.wav|237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_054.wav|237|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_112.wav|237|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_168.wav|237|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p237/p237_218.wav|237|She should not be blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_302.wav|238|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_134.wav|238|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_244.wav|238|Mr Blair had done well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_072.wav|238|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_008.wav|238|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_378.wav|238|It was really quite amazing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_187.wav|238|This is a frightening development.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_193.wav|238|The squad is too small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_066.wav|238|It's the performance we want.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_299.wav|238|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_250.wav|238|My Dad is a hero.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_120.wav|238|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_316.wav|238|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_384.wav|238|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_451.wav|238|It has become a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_271.wav|238|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_047.wav|238|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_337.wav|238|Abbey National is an option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_101.wav|238|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_115.wav|238|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_323.wav|238|The early physical reports were clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_053.wav|238|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_265.wav|238|The agreement remains the only show in town.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_029.wav|238|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_445.wav|238|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_359.wav|238|People should make their own decisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_390.wav|238|It's difficult to put a date on.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_249.wav|238|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_280.wav|238|You've got to be vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_139.wav|238|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_413.wav|238|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_143.wav|238|But it looks good for next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_375.wav|238|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_005.wav|238|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_233.wav|238|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_227.wav|238|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_011.wav|238|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_361.wav|238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_157.wav|238|The following are the principal provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_407.wav|238|And it had two seats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_294.wav|238|We've had great things in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_030.wav|238|Further management changes are planned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_206.wav|238|Truth is the child of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_176.wav|238|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_389.wav|238|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_340.wav|238|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_426.wav|238|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_083.wav|238|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_268.wav|238|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_097.wav|238|I was very pleased with them today, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_432.wav|238|It was like the old days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_118.wav|238|It's going to be epic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_354.wav|238|They're going to open in early summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_448.wav|238|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_162.wav|238|The milk industry is in turmoil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_212.wav|238|It is time for confession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_024.wav|238|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_331.wav|238|The move follows a review of the Singapore
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_107.wav|238|Their mandate is to target inflation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_277.wav|238|He is not a pathetic figure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_041.wav|238|She became a heroine of my childhood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_088.wav|238|It was exactly four months away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_382.wav|238|He did not say that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_169.wav|238|I can see it now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_443.wav|238|Still, some additions are inspired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_396.wav|238|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_219.wav|238|Bottling is now the core business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_055.wav|238|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_263.wav|238|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_113.wav|238|Those people must be accountable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_439.wav|238|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_325.wav|238|Their conclusions were never published.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_181.wav|238|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_148.wav|238|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_238.wav|238|Five years later, the deception continued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_242.wav|238|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_074.wav|238|We felt it was sufficient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_304.wav|238|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_418.wav|238|We have no information on Iraq.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_132.wav|238|Diversions were put in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_126.wav|238|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_310.wav|238|We are trying to clarify the issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_060.wav|238|Well, he is an artist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_256.wav|238|This wasn't just a big crowd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_195.wav|238|This Patton will also return.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_085.wav|238|It is somewhere to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_420.wav|238|They prefer the short, intensive session.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_170.wav|238|This is a step backwards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_346.wav|238|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_036.wav|238|Let there be no doubt about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_200.wav|238|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_214.wav|238|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_022.wav|238|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_352.wav|238|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_164.wav|238|Yet the survey has been cautious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_328.wav|238|Margins are also in retreat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_434.wav|238|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_091.wav|238|The result is utterly compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_058.wav|238|Have I really come to this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_003.wav|238|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_235.wav|238|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_145.wav|238|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_373.wav|238|But you never won any games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_415.wav|238|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_309.wav|238|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_079.wav|238|But the organisers refused to worry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_286.wav|238|Each case is treated on merit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_292.wav|238|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_401.wav|238|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_151.wav|238|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_198.wav|238|You are a gambling man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_221.wav|238|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_017.wav|238|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_192.wav|238|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_121.wav|238|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_317.wav|238|Here the picture is broadly stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_067.wav|238|Then they scored two goals to win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_298.wav|238|They will probably come back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_251.wav|238|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_245.wav|238|I was a lucky man tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_073.wav|238|And then there's the racial hassle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_303.wav|238|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_135.wav|238|No one person or small group could be singled out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_379.wav|238|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_186.wav|238|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_009.wav|238|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_052.wav|238|He is too weak to move.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_264.wav|238|It is a terrible tragedy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_114.wav|238|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_322.wav|238|And we have the experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_444.wav|238|I believe we can handle this okay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_358.wav|238|He remains a main board director of Royal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_391.wav|238|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_028.wav|238|There was a rush of water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_385.wav|238|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_450.wav|238|Either way, it's very funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_336.wav|238|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_100.wav|238|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_270.wav|238|It's never great to finish second.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_046.wav|238|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_360.wav|238|I saw them last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_156.wav|238|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_226.wav|238|I am considered a teenager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_010.wav|238|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_295.wav|238|It has been recorded twice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_406.wav|238|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_138.wav|238|Monty is great in his own backyard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_412.wav|238|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_248.wav|238|It would seem a natural progression.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_281.wav|238|First, the programme was unbalanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_004.wav|238|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_232.wav|238|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_142.wav|238|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_374.wav|238|It didn't matter who was in their way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_433.wav|238|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_119.wav|238|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_269.wav|238|It was a bit of a tightrope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_096.wav|238|He was at home with his pals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_213.wav|238|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_025.wav|238|Smoking is also very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_355.wav|238|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_449.wav|238|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_163.wav|238|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_177.wav|238|The changes took effect from June.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_388.wav|238|His successor was only appointed last month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_341.wav|238|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_031.wav|238|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_207.wav|238|There was a fine line to tread.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_082.wav|238|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_427.wav|238|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_218.wav|238|We will try to find someone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_168.wav|238|They almost achieved a draw.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_442.wav|238|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_397.wav|238|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_112.wav|238|Harrowing is easy, after all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_438.wav|238|We discovered that for ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_324.wav|238|Celtic were the losers then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_054.wav|238|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_262.wav|238|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_276.wav|238|They could not match it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_040.wav|238|I remember that day well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_089.wav|238|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_330.wav|238|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_106.wav|238|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_383.wav|238|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_456.wav|238|Now it has doubled in size.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_061.wav|238|We work for the athlete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_257.wav|238|It was a terrible combination of factors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_127.wav|238|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_311.wav|238|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_194.wav|238|He has had success at every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_239.wav|238|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_180.wav|238|Since then, things have improved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_149.wav|238|And they all have a vote.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_305.wav|238|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_419.wav|238|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_133.wav|238|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_243.wav|238|It is crucial for both teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_075.wav|238|The wingers must have felt the cold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_353.wav|238|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_165.wav|238|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_215.wav|238|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_023.wav|238|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_090.wav|238|He thought she was amazing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_059.wav|238|They desperately want some stability.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_329.wav|238|Golf is not like that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_435.wav|238|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_421.wav|238|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_084.wav|238|He's very young and very keen to do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_037.wav|238|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_201.wav|238|Did it work?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_171.wav|238|I've no idea how it works.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_347.wav|238|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_400.wav|238|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_293.wav|238|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_220.wav|238|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_016.wav|238|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_366.wav|238|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_150.wav|238|It is a vicious circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_199.wav|238|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_144.wav|238|All the employees are redundant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_372.wav|238|But the rally was short-lived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_002.wav|238|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_234.wav|238|There's always the next century.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_078.wav|238|No plans for projects are yet in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_287.wav|238|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_414.wav|238|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_308.wav|238|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_386.wav|238|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_179.wav|238|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_453.wav|238|It seemed a logical expansion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_209.wav|238|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_273.wav|238|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_045.wav|238|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_335.wav|238|He was admitted to hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_103.wav|238|The fans would love it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_429.wav|238|Not many people like to do that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_117.wav|238|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_321.wav|238|We believe a third party was involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_051.wav|238|And they removed a Borderer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_098.wav|238|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_267.wav|238|The strong performance is expected to continue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_447.wav|238|I stayed away from the defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_392.wav|238|Those overseas offices were great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_300.wav|238|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_136.wav|238|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_246.wav|238|Then we will face the Danish champions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_070.wav|238|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_185.wav|238|But we could only help a handful of people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_191.wav|238|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_158.wav|238|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_228.wav|238|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_064.wav|238|He will need that machine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_252.wav|238|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_408.wav|238|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_122.wav|238|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_314.wav|238|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_032.wav|238|The staff are very good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_204.wav|238|How independent is that?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_174.wav|238|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_342.wav|238|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_424.wav|238|Got to get my sunglasses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_338.wav|238|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_081.wav|238|We should be able to cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_048.wav|238|Among them are many criminals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_095.wav|238|It wasn't possible to relax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_430.wav|238|We accept the new rules.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_356.wav|238|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_160.wav|238|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_026.wav|238|The first appeared to be successful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_282.wav|238|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_411.wav|238|This is a historic occasion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_141.wav|238|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_188.wav|238|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_377.wav|238|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_007.wav|238|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_231.wav|238|So I got a blood test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_225.wav|238|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_013.wav|238|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_363.wav|238|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_155.wav|238|That's what happened against Ayr.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_319.wav|238|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_405.wav|238|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_296.wav|238|But there's an upturn in the sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_069.wav|238|The partnership was set up during the summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_460.wav|238|It is business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_183.wav|238|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_289.wav|238|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_240.wav|238|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_076.wav|238|I am relishing the challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_306.wav|238|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_130.wav|238|Potions said he would drive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_124.wav|238|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_312.wav|238|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_062.wav|238|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_254.wav|238|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_018.wav|238|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_197.wav|238|His words were not audible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_368.wav|238|We can have no complaints.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_333.wav|238|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_105.wav|238|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_275.wav|238|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_043.wav|238|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_039.wav|238|And so was a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_349.wav|238|My father died in childbirth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_380.wav|238|It is the voice of the survivors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_455.wav|238|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_441.wav|238|None of this work is guaranteed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_394.wav|238|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_057.wav|238|Has the conflict started?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_261.wav|238|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_111.wav|238|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_327.wav|238|Little is known about them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_001.wav|238|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_237.wav|238|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_147.wav|238|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_371.wav|238|We will likely look for new investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_417.wav|238|This would discourage investment and job creation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_284.wav|238|This championship is different from the other majors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_259.wav|238|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_290.wav|238|We've just had it confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_129.wav|238|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_403.wav|238|That remains the unanswered question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_365.wav|238|His background is firmly in venture capital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_223.wav|238|We were right to be afraid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_015.wav|238|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_087.wav|238|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_278.wav|238|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_422.wav|238|The company declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_108.wav|238|We have thought about doing lots of things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_458.wav|238|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_172.wav|238|We continue to hold the shares.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_344.wav|238|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_034.wav|238|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_202.wav|238|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_216.wav|238|It was started almost by accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_020.wav|238|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_399.wav|238|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_350.wav|238|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_166.wav|238|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_436.wav|238|The only problem was, they were on himself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_093.wav|238|He seems to have everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_050.wav|238|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_099.wav|238|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_266.wav|238|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_116.wav|238|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_320.wav|238|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_446.wav|238|Hard cash is needed now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_393.wav|238|You will have seen the adverts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_208.wav|238|The refund is fully justified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_387.wav|238|Pensions are a long-term investment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_178.wav|238|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_452.wav|238|We didn't want any trouble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_334.wav|238|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_102.wav|238|It's very dangerous for markets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_428.wav|238|Messages have to be reinforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_272.wav|238|Her political persuasion is no secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_044.wav|238|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_229.wav|238|That view has not altered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_190.wav|238|You just have to accept.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_159.wav|238|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_409.wav|238|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_123.wav|238|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_315.wav|238|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_065.wav|238|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_253.wav|238|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_247.wav|238|But it couldn't happen overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_071.wav|238|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_301.wav|238|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_137.wav|238|I won't make an official complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_184.wav|238|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_431.wav|238|We go there with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_094.wav|238|There can be no compromise on welfare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_211.wav|238|But experts have disputed that statistic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_027.wav|238|We must convince the citizens.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_357.wav|238|And the World Cup has not even begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_161.wav|238|He was just like a godfather to it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_175.wav|238|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_343.wav|238|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_033.wav|238|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_080.wav|238|We have to keep our clients.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_049.wav|238|It comes from reflection or thinking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_425.wav|238|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_339.wav|238|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_362.wav|238|It was a good workout.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_154.wav|238|They make a selective perception process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_224.wav|238|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_012.wav|238|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_297.wav|238|I'm interested in interesting work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_068.wav|238|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_318.wav|238|Sadly, it does not end there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_404.wav|238|Everything has its place and purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_410.wav|238|But nothing could be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_283.wav|238|Phase one was a shambles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_006.wav|238|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_230.wav|238|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_140.wav|238|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_189.wav|238|This should begin in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_376.wav|238|I have little time for analysts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_063.wav|238|Everything else is a bonus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_255.wav|238|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_125.wav|238|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_313.wav|238|Movie stars are public property.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_196.wav|238|Tiger is not the norm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_369.wav|238|The statement contained no surprises.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_019.wav|238|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_182.wav|238|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_307.wav|238|Friday night was a pretty good night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_131.wav|238|This is a sizeable part of our business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_288.wav|238|Says the Duke of York.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_241.wav|238|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_077.wav|238|I have made that offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_440.wav|238|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_395.wav|238|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_110.wav|238|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_326.wav|238|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_056.wav|238|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_260.wav|238|It's about time something was done about equipment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_274.wav|238|He is a right bastard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_042.wav|238|We want to get back into the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_332.wav|238|Which isn't a bad idea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_104.wav|238|That would be the case with Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_381.wav|238|It was cynical and callous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_454.wav|238|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_038.wav|238|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_128.wav|238|He put some colour into Scottish history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_402.wav|238|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_258.wav|238|This is absolutely not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_291.wav|238|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_222.wav|238|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_014.wav|238|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_364.wav|238|William Hague delighted his party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_152.wav|238|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_146.wav|238|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_370.wav|238|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_236.wav|238|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_285.wav|238|But I was glad to see these interviews.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_416.wav|238|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_398.wav|238|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_351.wav|238|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_167.wav|238|We can't get over it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_217.wav|238|I will not take part in Edmonton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_021.wav|238|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_092.wav|238|Final proposals will be published in February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_437.wav|238|We are aiming for early March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_423.wav|238|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_109.wav|238|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_086.wav|238|We should all be grateful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_279.wav|238|I came up through the ranks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_035.wav|238|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_203.wav|238|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_459.wav|238|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_173.wav|238|The festivals will be about having fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p238/p238_345.wav|238|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_038.wav|239|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_348.wav|239|It comes from reflection or thinking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_381.wav|239|We have not been approached.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_454.wav|239|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_332.wav|239|January is a bad time of year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_104.wav|239|I am so proud of him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_274.wav|239|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_042.wav|239|Have I really come to this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_056.wav|239|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_260.wav|239|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_110.wav|239|I can't remember a lot of it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_326.wav|239|They are looking at a flotation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_489.wav|239|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_440.wav|239|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_395.wav|239|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_288.wav|239|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_241.wav|239|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_077.wav|239|He phoned the number in the brochure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_307.wav|239|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_131.wav|239|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_461.wav|239|Inventories are coming under control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_182.wav|239|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_019.wav|239|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_196.wav|239|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_475.wav|239|I am sorry, but I forgot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_369.wav|239|They are the innocent victims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_125.wav|239|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_313.wav|239|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_063.wav|239|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_255.wav|239|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_459.wav|239|This is a great opportunity for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_173.wav|239|She is in good spirits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_490.wav|239|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_345.wav|239|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_035.wav|239|I might well have done so already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_203.wav|239|It is all to do with the coaching.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_086.wav|239|Or so the theory goes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_279.wav|239|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_423.wav|239|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_109.wav|239|People will have to be patient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_437.wav|239|Things are going to change over the next six months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_092.wav|239|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_217.wav|239|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_021.wav|239|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_398.wav|239|We were beaten by the better team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_351.wav|239|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_484.wav|239|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_167.wav|239|We have reacted well to each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_416.wav|239|You're not getting any goodwill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_285.wav|239|It has been recorded twice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_236.wav|239|My Dad is a hero.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_146.wav|239|He was forced to quit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_370.wav|239|It didn't matter who was in their way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_364.wav|239|The statement contained no surprises.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_152.wav|239|Since then, things have improved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_478.wav|239|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_222.wav|239|There's always the next century.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_014.wav|239|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_258.wav|239|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_291.wav|239|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_128.wav|239|How independent is that?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_402.wav|239|I have received no explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_467.wav|239|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_184.wav|239|Structural changes were also required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_301.wav|239|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_137.wav|239|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_247.wav|239|I've learned from my mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_071.wav|239|Then they scored two goals to win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_065.wav|239|They desperately want some stability.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_253.wav|239|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_409.wav|239|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_123.wav|239|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_315.wav|239|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_190.wav|239|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_473.wav|239|The response from everyone was wonderful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_159.wav|239|It was the climax of the thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_229.wav|239|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_272.wav|239|A winter of discontent awaits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_044.wav|239|It carried a double message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_334.wav|239|Royal Bank declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_102.wav|239|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_428.wav|239|Or maybe it's the other way around.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_387.wav|239|She asked for the appointment with me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_178.wav|239|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_452.wav|239|We didn't want any trouble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_208.wav|239|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_500.wav|239|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_446.wav|239|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_393.wav|239|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_116.wav|239|I've had it for the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_320.wav|239|I have been very nervous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_050.wav|239|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_099.wav|239|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_266.wav|239|He is not a pathetic figure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_140.wav|239|So it was at Easter Road.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_189.wav|239|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_376.wav|239|It was launched in February last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_006.wav|239|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_230.wav|239|She had gone to the Catholic school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_283.wav|239|We've had great things in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_410.wav|239|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_318.wav|239|The result is utterly compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_404.wav|239|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_297.wav|239|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_068.wav|239|I'm pleased with the horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_224.wav|239|But it's an enjoyable job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_012.wav|239|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_362.wav|239|Walker plans to return indoors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_154.wav|239|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_425.wav|239|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_339.wav|239|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_080.wav|239|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_049.wav|239|We must learn to finish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_033.wav|239|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_205.wav|239|The refund is fully justified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_175.wav|239|Mr Blair should be warned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_496.wav|239|I can hardly believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_343.wav|239|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_357.wav|239|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_482.wav|239|The death toll included five children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_161.wav|239|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_211.wav|239|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_027.wav|239|And so was a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_094.wav|239|But I had never been in a theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_431.wav|239|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_111.wav|239|Instead, another depression came in.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_327.wav|239|They make a selective perception process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_057.wav|239|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_261.wav|239|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_488.wav|239|Holland won by five wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_441.wav|239|The stage was set for a showdown.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_394.wav|239|His leader wanted to celebrate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_349.wav|239|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_380.wav|239|Pensions are a long-term investment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_455.wav|239|And Michael was just great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_039.wav|239|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_275.wav|239|It's going to be very closely watched.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_043.wav|239|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_333.wav|239|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_105.wav|239|This time, it might be for real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_197.wav|239|You've got to be vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_474.wav|239|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_368.wav|239|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_018.wav|239|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_062.wav|239|Perhaps we should do the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_254.wav|239|She replied, It could be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_124.wav|239|He was just a journalist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_312.wav|239|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_306.wav|239|This will be our new beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_130.wav|239|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_289.wav|239|This youngster is so exciting!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_240.wav|239|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_076.wav|239|The Government does not go far enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_460.wav|239|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_183.wav|239|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_093.wav|239|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_436.wav|239|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_399.wav|239|Both sides have to step back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_350.wav|239|Translation - we got it wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_485.wav|239|I was there five months ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_166.wav|239|They exist in name alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_216.wav|239|We had to add value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_020.wav|239|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_034.wav|239|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_202.wav|239|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_458.wav|239|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_172.wav|239|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_491.wav|239|It's unlikely to be renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_344.wav|239|The FBI could become involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_422.wav|239|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_108.wav|239|He was a lovely man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_087.wav|239|He has really done well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_278.wav|239|Our destiny is in our own hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_223.wav|239|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_015.wav|239|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_365.wav|239|The scientific debate is dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_153.wav|239|That's what happened against Ayr.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_479.wav|239|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_129.wav|239|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_403.wav|239|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_259.wav|239|We have expanded too quickly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_290.wav|239|It was a pre-emptive strike.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_284.wav|239|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_417.wav|239|The baby deserves the credit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_147.wav|239|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_371.wav|239|He ended up a headmaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_001.wav|239|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_237.wav|239|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_408.wav|239|It seems a waste of talents.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_122.wav|239|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_314.wav|239|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_064.wav|239|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_252.wav|239|The strong performance is expected to continue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_228.wav|239|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_191.wav|239|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_472.wav|239|We need a visionary producer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_158.wav|239|Our relationship has been very good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_466.wav|239|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_185.wav|239|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_246.wav|239|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_070.wav|239|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_300.wav|239|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_136.wav|239|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_447.wav|239|Hard cash is needed now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_392.wav|239|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_501.wav|239|You are a different people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_051.wav|239|New York is my home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_098.wav|239|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_267.wav|239|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_117.wav|239|Those people must be accountable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_321.wav|239|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_335.wav|239|From there, they can go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_103.wav|239|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_429.wav|239|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_273.wav|239|I thought we were fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_045.wav|239|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_209.wav|239|He is a very talented player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_386.wav|239|Well, that's just a third district.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_179.wav|239|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_453.wav|239|It seemed a logical expansion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_296.wav|239|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_069.wav|239|He will need that machine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_319.wav|239|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_405.wav|239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_363.wav|239|The actual increases will be announced next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_155.wav|239|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_225.wav|239|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_013.wav|239|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_007.wav|239|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_231.wav|239|Then we will face the Danish champions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_141.wav|239|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_188.wav|239|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_377.wav|239|Commitment is released on Liberty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_411.wav|239|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_282.wav|239|There is no internal damage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_210.wav|239|Bottling is now the core business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_026.wav|239|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_356.wav|239|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_483.wav|239|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_160.wav|239|Nato has left them with no other option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_430.wav|239|We accept the new rules.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_095.wav|239|It was fun, but not a living.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_081.wav|239|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_048.wav|239|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_424.wav|239|The capital costs are modest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_338.wav|239|We used to live with dignity in our country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_174.wav|239|As if that is an achievement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_497.wav|239|They haven't been thought through.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_342.wav|239|I am considered a teenager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_032.wav|239|That's all I was trying to do today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_204.wav|239|There was a fine line to tread.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_243.wav|239|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_075.wav|239|Let's not be too despondent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_305.wav|239|They have played their part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_419.wav|239|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_133.wav|239|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_463.wav|239|We will provide immediate access.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_180.wav|239|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_149.wav|239|I was given no instructions by no-one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_239.wav|239|This is absolutely not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_194.wav|239|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_477.wav|239|We did something about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_127.wav|239|Diversions were put in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_311.wav|239|Celtic were the losers then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_061.wav|239|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_257.wav|239|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_383.wav|239|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_456.wav|239|Now it has doubled in size.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_330.wav|239|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_106.wav|239|He will be kept informed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_276.wav|239|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_040.wav|239|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_089.wav|239|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_054.wav|239|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_262.wav|239|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_112.wav|239|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_438.wav|239|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_324.wav|239|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_168.wav|239|I can see it now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_442.wav|239|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_397.wav|239|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_218.wav|239|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_414.wav|239|It depends on Labour, not on us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_308.wav|239|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_078.wav|239|I haven't got there yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_287.wav|239|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_002.wav|239|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_234.wav|239|We will turn the corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_144.wav|239|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_372.wav|239|That took about two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_366.wav|239|This would include the GM food industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_150.wav|239|The move follows a review of the Singapore
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_199.wav|239|Tiger is not the norm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_220.wav|239|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_016.wav|239|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_293.wav|239|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_400.wav|239|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_171.wav|239|Those three weeks are totally lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_492.wav|239|MOVIE stars are public property.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_347.wav|239|And the World Cup has not even begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_037.wav|239|He works at the airport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_201.wav|239|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_084.wav|239|And it had two seats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_421.wav|239|It makes no difference to their friendship.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_329.wav|239|He was admitted to hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_435.wav|239|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_090.wav|239|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_059.wav|239|That's been the difference between the sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_215.wav|239|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_023.wav|239|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_353.wav|239|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_486.wav|239|It happened again, and again, and again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_165.wav|239|This was a unique election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_270.wav|239|Harrowing is easy, after all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_046.wav|239|But not a penny has been paid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_336.wav|239|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_100.wav|239|Sales are falling after years of growth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_385.wav|239|Those overseas offices were great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_499.wav|239|I am not unduly surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_450.wav|239|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_028.wav|239|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_502.wav|239|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_444.wav|239|Any error is severely punished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_358.wav|239|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_391.wav|239|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_114.wav|239|It is sometimes like that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_322.wav|239|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_052.wav|239|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_264.wav|239|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_009.wav|239|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_379.wav|239|He did not say that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_465.wav|239|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_186.wav|239|That was just one night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_303.wav|239|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_135.wav|239|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_245.wav|239|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_073.wav|239|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_067.wav|239|Everyone could see the joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_298.wav|239|We may need to take some very radical measures.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_251.wav|239|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_121.wav|239|The error appeared in a warrant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_317.wav|239|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_192.wav|239|My father died in childbirth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_471.wav|239|There's nothing I can say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_427.wav|239|This idea has been around for four years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_082.wav|239|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_031.wav|239|There was a rush of water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_207.wav|239|We are now working with full-time on future product.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_177.wav|239|There was a fossil on screen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_494.wav|239|The songs are just so good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_388.wav|239|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_341.wav|239|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_355.wav|239|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_449.wav|239|Blair also had a penalty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_480.wav|239|Five years later, the deception continued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_163.wav|239|I understand the medical concerns.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_213.wav|239|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_025.wav|239|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_269.wav|239|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_096.wav|239|Kenny Miller might come through.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_433.wav|239|He was released after treatment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_119.wav|239|The Festival is prepared to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_142.wav|239|Absences should be carefully monitored.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_468.wav|239|The money is within the total allocation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_374.wav|239|That remains the unanswered question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_004.wav|239|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_232.wav|239|It would seem a natural progression.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_248.wav|239|Adams is surely worth a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_281.wav|239|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_138.wav|239|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_412.wav|239|This would discourage investment and job creation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_406.wav|239|This game is very evenly balanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_295.wav|239|Friday night was a pretty good night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_226.wav|239|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_010.wav|239|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_360.wav|239|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_156.wav|239|It is a good lifestyle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_195.wav|239|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_476.wav|239|Banking stocks were hit hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_060.wav|239|And they removed a Borderer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_256.wav|239|Her political persuasion is no secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_126.wav|239|Their season has been consigned to history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_310.wav|239|Racism has no place in any sport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_304.wav|239|That should give me a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_418.wav|239|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_132.wav|239|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_242.wav|239|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_074.wav|239|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_238.wav|239|Further details are expected later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_462.wav|239|She failed in her action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_181.wav|239|Did it work?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_148.wav|239|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_113.wav|239|We have thought about doing lots of things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_439.wav|239|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_325.wav|239|It wasn't about her singing, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_055.wav|239|He is too weak to move.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_263.wav|239|Our position remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_219.wav|239|So I got a blood test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_169.wav|239|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_443.wav|239|They should not feel under threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_396.wav|239|This fact is supported by audience research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_382.wav|239|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_457.wav|239|It was never a free kick.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_277.wav|239|They receive a high profile in the media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_041.wav|239|Has the conflict started?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_088.wav|239|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_331.wav|239|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_107.wav|239|There could be a way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_221.wav|239|I was caught out a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_017.wav|239|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_367.wav|239|But the rally was short-lived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_151.wav|239|Which isn't a bad idea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_198.wav|239|He said the director had been completely friendly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_401.wav|239|Everything has its place and purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_292.wav|239|They will probably come back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_079.wav|239|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_286.wav|239|Aberdeen had little to offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_415.wav|239|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_309.wav|239|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_145.wav|239|We just have to adapt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_373.wav|239|He is obviously very dangerous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_003.wav|239|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_235.wav|239|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_091.wav|239|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_058.wav|239|Among them are many criminals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_328.wav|239|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_434.wav|239|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_352.wav|239|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_487.wav|239|It could well be military.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_164.wav|239|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_214.wav|239|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_022.wav|239|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_036.wav|239|That can cost him a fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_200.wav|239|It's been a humbling year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_170.wav|239|There's still plenty time left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_493.wav|239|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_346.wav|239|I just felt that I was broken down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_420.wav|239|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_085.wav|239|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_445.wav|239|Either group is living in fantasy land.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_359.wav|239|William Hague delighted his party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_390.wav|239|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_029.wav|239|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_503.wav|239|The world record is suspicious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_053.wav|239|I remember that day well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_265.wav|239|They could not match it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_115.wav|239|The partners are looking for answers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_323.wav|239|I won't make an official complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_337.wav|239|Twaddle is a case in point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_101.wav|239|It was exactly four months away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_271.wav|239|Each case is treated on merit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_047.wav|239|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_384.wav|239|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_498.wav|239|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_451.wav|239|Either way, it's very funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_120.wav|239|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_316.wav|239|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_066.wav|239|Everything is possible in football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_299.wav|239|Everyone can have their opinion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_250.wav|239|I've come here for the jersey.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_193.wav|239|In addition, margins have been maintained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_470.wav|239|This does not create any precedent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_378.wav|239|I love the spectacle of cinema.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_464.wav|239|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_187.wav|239|This is a frightening development.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_008.wav|239|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_244.wav|239|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_072.wav|239|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_302.wav|239|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_134.wav|239|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_212.wav|239|The protest will go ahead as planned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_024.wav|239|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_354.wav|239|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_448.wav|239|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_481.wav|239|The rescue package is public money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_162.wav|239|I think the referee was good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_432.wav|239|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_118.wav|239|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_268.wav|239|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_097.wav|239|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_426.wav|239|It certainly feels that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_176.wav|239|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_495.wav|239|The whole thing was just unreal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_389.wav|239|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_340.wav|239|It will affect their work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_030.wav|239|It is about control of our economy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_206.wav|239|My wife and family are the support system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_294.wav|239|I saw them last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_407.wav|239|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_361.wav|239|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_157.wav|239|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_227.wav|239|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_011.wav|239|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_005.wav|239|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_233.wav|239|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_143.wav|239|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_469.wav|239|The partnership was set up during the summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_375.wav|239|This should come as no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_139.wav|239|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_413.wav|239|We have no information on Iraq.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_249.wav|239|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p239/p239_280.wav|239|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_290.wav|240|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_259.wav|240|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_129.wav|240|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_365.wav|240|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_153.wav|240|Mr Blair had done well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_223.wav|240|That has been the easy part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_015.wav|240|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_001.wav|240|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_237.wav|240|It is not the message alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_147.wav|240|They did very well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_371.wav|240|That would help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_284.wav|240|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_216.wav|240|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_020.wav|240|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_166.wav|240|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_093.wav|240|We could not get any possession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_087.wav|240|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_278.wav|240|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_108.wav|240|It's a shame.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_172.wav|240|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_344.wav|240|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_034.wav|240|People love to see this stuff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_202.wav|240|Who will pay for this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_124.wav|240|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_312.wav|240|The plot is minimal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_062.wav|240|I've had six days of rehearsal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_254.wav|240|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_018.wav|240|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_197.wav|240|It wasn't to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_368.wav|240|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_183.wav|240|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_240.wav|240|But it's a subtle process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_289.wav|240|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_076.wav|240|She died in hospital two hours later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_306.wav|240|The home was now under new management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_130.wav|240|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_057.wav|240|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_261.wav|240|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_111.wav|240|It's a question of perception.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_327.wav|240|Referees are easy targets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_333.wav|240|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_105.wav|240|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_275.wav|240|And Michael was just great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_043.wav|240|President Bush is at war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_039.wav|240|They're just different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_380.wav|240|Safety was also an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_349.wav|240|He has to learn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_095.wav|240|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_160.wav|240|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_210.wav|240|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_026.wav|240|But it failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_032.wav|240|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_204.wav|240|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_174.wav|240|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_342.wav|240|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_338.wav|240|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_048.wav|240|That period was a struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_081.wav|240|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_225.wav|240|But it will be sorted out this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_013.wav|240|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_363.wav|240|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_155.wav|240|My Dad is a hero.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_319.wav|240|They were fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_296.wav|240|It's like a high school play.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_069.wav|240|It should be devolved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_282.wav|240|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_188.wav|240|It is tough, but possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_141.wav|240|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_377.wav|240|He later became a respected High Court judge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_007.wav|240|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_231.wav|240|They are the innocent victims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_117.wav|240|I joined a group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_321.wav|240|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_098.wav|240|It was a good performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_051.wav|240|It's a blessing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_267.wav|240|Blood samples were taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_179.wav|240|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_209.wav|240|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_273.wav|240|Have a look at our accounts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_045.wav|240|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_335.wav|240|The police have to act to help them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_103.wav|240|They will want to perform well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_158.wav|240|Was this element always there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_191.wav|240|The procedure is the same in all cases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_228.wav|240|It is a gamble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_064.wav|240|Art is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_252.wav|240|He got the same story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_122.wav|240|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_314.wav|240|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_300.wav|240|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_136.wav|240|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_246.wav|240|It is hard won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_070.wav|240|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_185.wav|240|We want to help them through it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_146.wav|240|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_370.wav|240|Hartley should know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_236.wav|240|Jobs could go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_285.wav|240|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_128.wav|240|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_291.wav|240|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_258.wav|240|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_222.wav|240|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_014.wav|240|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_364.wav|240|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_152.wav|240|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_109.wav|240|It had been played at festivals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_086.wav|240|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_279.wav|240|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_035.wav|240|He took me on a tour of the wards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_203.wav|240|They've got three-quarters of the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_173.wav|240|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_345.wav|240|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_351.wav|240|Look at the witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_167.wav|240|That must be left to the Parole Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_217.wav|240|I was so nervous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_021.wav|240|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_092.wav|240|She told The Herald.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_182.wav|240|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_307.wav|240|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_131.wav|240|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_241.wav|240|Of further privacy, he had no need.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_288.wav|240|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_077.wav|240|Is there a new way forward?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_063.wav|240|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_255.wav|240|A friendship that will endure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_125.wav|240|I was furious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_313.wav|240|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_196.wav|240|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_369.wav|240|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_019.wav|240|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_274.wav|240|He was also married with two children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_042.wav|240|Indeed, he does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_332.wav|240|I am so upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_104.wav|240|That all hope is never lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_348.wav|240|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_038.wav|240|It has failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_110.wav|240|I came to complete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_326.wav|240|It is out there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_056.wav|240|He had no enemies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_260.wav|240|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_175.wav|240|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_343.wav|240|It is a sign of hope.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_033.wav|240|This is the window.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_205.wav|240|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_049.wav|240|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_080.wav|240|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_339.wav|240|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_094.wav|240|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_211.wav|240|We'll have to work hard today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_027.wav|240|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_357.wav|240|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_161.wav|240|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_283.wav|240|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_006.wav|240|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_230.wav|240|It's so special.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_189.wav|240|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_140.wav|240|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_376.wav|240|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_362.wav|240|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_154.wav|240|I was in daily contact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_224.wav|240|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_012.wav|240|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_297.wav|240|Who did the recruiting?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_068.wav|240|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_318.wav|240|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_208.wav|240|It's a mixture of everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_178.wav|240|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_334.wav|240|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_102.wav|240|He takes the job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_272.wav|240|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_044.wav|240|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_099.wav|240|I see no need for change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_050.wav|240|Who can say?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_266.wav|240|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_116.wav|240|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_320.wav|240|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_247.wav|240|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_071.wav|240|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_301.wav|240|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_137.wav|240|He was in a great deal of pain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_184.wav|240|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_229.wav|240|At the time, he was a living legend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_159.wav|240|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_190.wav|240|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_123.wav|240|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_315.wav|240|It is no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_065.wav|240|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_253.wav|240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_214.wav|240|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_022.wav|240|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_352.wav|240|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_164.wav|240|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_328.wav|240|They had a confession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_058.wav|240|However the drama was still not at an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_091.wav|240|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_085.wav|240|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_170.wav|240|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_346.wav|240|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_036.wav|240|It is marvellous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_200.wav|240|But we are not immune to the problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_292.wav|240|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_367.wav|240|As, indeed, they would be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_198.wav|240|There was no option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_151.wav|240|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_221.wav|240|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_017.wav|240|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_003.wav|240|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_235.wav|240|And thought we would get away with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_145.wav|240|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_373.wav|240|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_309.wav|240|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_079.wav|240|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_286.wav|240|If not, he should go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_169.wav|240|They will do their own thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_219.wav|240|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_055.wav|240|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_263.wav|240|I was happily surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_113.wav|240|This film will be totally awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_325.wav|240|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_331.wav|240|Donald was his friend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_107.wav|240|It's in his blood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_277.wav|240|Access has been a nightmare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_088.wav|240|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_041.wav|240|It was the eighties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_126.wav|240|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_310.wav|240|We do not expect any surplus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_060.wav|240|That's the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_256.wav|240|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_195.wav|240|I am totally surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_148.wav|240|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_181.wav|240|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_238.wav|240|It's quite a line-up!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_242.wav|240|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_074.wav|240|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_304.wav|240|I was the sheep.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_132.wav|240|It was the same at Twickenham.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_227.wav|240|I am immensely sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_011.wav|240|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_361.wav|240|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_157.wav|240|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_294.wav|240|Maloney is an engaging talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_280.wav|240|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_249.wav|240|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_139.wav|240|It seems so long since I did the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_143.wav|240|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_375.wav|240|We are looking for perfection.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_005.wav|240|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_233.wav|240|The body follows the mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_268.wav|240|There is no link.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_097.wav|240|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_118.wav|240|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_354.wav|240|The composer will conduct.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_162.wav|240|I was in the train station overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_212.wav|240|She should not be blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_024.wav|240|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_030.wav|240|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_206.wav|240|It's all about money, money, money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_176.wav|240|They know no other way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_340.wav|240|I've not thought about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_083.wav|240|He is in the queue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_193.wav|240|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_066.wav|240|They are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_250.wav|240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_299.wav|240|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_120.wav|240|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_316.wav|240|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_302.wav|240|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_134.wav|240|It is also well received.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_244.wav|240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_072.wav|240|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_008.wav|240|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_378.wav|240|It's been hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_187.wav|240|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_115.wav|240|I'm delighted about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_323.wav|240|Henman has been warned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_053.wav|240|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_265.wav|240|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_029.wav|240|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_359.wav|240|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_271.wav|240|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_047.wav|240|It is so sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_337.wav|240|It could have gone either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_101.wav|240|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_084.wav|240|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_037.wav|240|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_201.wav|240|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_171.wav|240|It's quite a routine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_347.wav|240|It is so unfair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_353.wav|240|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_165.wav|240|Tell it like it was?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_215.wav|240|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_023.wav|240|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_059.wav|240|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_090.wav|240|That will come after the game on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_329.wav|240|We do the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_144.wav|240|I am just trying to do my job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_372.wav|240|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_002.wav|240|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_234.wav|240|However, no further action was taken by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_078.wav|240|I've got the shirt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_308.wav|240|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_293.wav|240|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_220.wav|240|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_016.wav|240|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_366.wav|240|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_199.wav|240|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_150.wav|240|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_276.wav|240|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_089.wav|240|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_040.wav|240|It's a real threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_330.wav|240|That's the law of the land.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_106.wav|240|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_218.wav|240|Work has started.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_168.wav|240|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_112.wav|240|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_324.wav|240|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_054.wav|240|He is too weak to move.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_262.wav|240|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_239.wav|240|It's very safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_149.wav|240|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_180.wav|240|They will run a mile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_305.wav|240|There was no hint of scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_133.wav|240|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_243.wav|240|We were extremely poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_075.wav|240|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_061.wav|240|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_257.wav|240|Her presence was almost everywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_127.wav|240|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_311.wav|240|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_194.wav|240|It is a farce.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_138.wav|240|We want to keep the pound.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_281.wav|240|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_248.wav|240|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_004.wav|240|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_232.wav|240|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_142.wav|240|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_374.wav|240|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_360.wav|240|He had played well in that central role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_156.wav|240|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_226.wav|240|What was the main difference?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_010.wav|240|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_295.wav|240|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_177.wav|240|There is no point in looking any further.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_341.wav|240|Who was the mystery MP?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_031.wav|240|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_207.wav|240|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_082.wav|240|What has changed?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_119.wav|240|She really suffered for her art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_269.wav|240|This is a question of Islam.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_096.wav|240|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_213.wav|240|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_025.wav|240|Johnson was pretty low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_355.wav|240|This is a friendly match?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_163.wav|240|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_245.wav|240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_073.wav|240|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_303.wav|240|He said she was mad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_135.wav|240|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_379.wav|240|It's now down in black and white.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_186.wav|240|They really did a great job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_009.wav|240|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_192.wav|240|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_121.wav|240|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_317.wav|240|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_067.wav|240|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_251.wav|240|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_298.wav|240|He was obviously very genuine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_336.wav|240|We agreed to disagree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_100.wav|240|We have every respect for Michelle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_270.wav|240|It looks as though he will be right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_046.wav|240|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_052.wav|240|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_264.wav|240|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_114.wav|240|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_322.wav|240|The election is total confusion and chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_358.wav|240|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p240/p240_028.wav|240|Is this accurate?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_163.wav|241|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_213.wav|241|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_025.wav|241|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_269.wav|241|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_096.wav|241|The peace process will be buried!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_119.wav|241|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_082.wav|241|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_031.wav|241|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_207.wav|241|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_177.wav|241|The clarity is vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_295.wav|241|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_226.wav|241|My neighbours are horrified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_010.wav|241|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_360.wav|241|We are looking for perfection.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_142.wav|241|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_374.wav|241|There is no signature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_004.wav|241|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_232.wav|241|Hospitals are for the ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_281.wav|241|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_248.wav|241|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_138.wav|241|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_028.wav|241|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_358.wav|241|That would help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_114.wav|241|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_322.wav|241|It is a strong case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_052.wav|241|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_264.wav|241|Immediate action must be taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_270.wav|241|Access has been a nightmare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_046.wav|241|That time has passed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_336.wav|241|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_100.wav|241|It was mayhem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_067.wav|241|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_251.wav|241|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_298.wav|241|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_121.wav|241|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_317.wav|241|It is out there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_192.wav|241|I wanted to put myself on the line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_009.wav|241|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_186.wav|241|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_303.wav|241|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_135.wav|241|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_245.wav|241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_073.wav|241|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_366.wav|241|He could face a jail sentence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_199.wav|241|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_150.wav|241|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_220.wav|241|A career as a doctor is on hold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_016.wav|241|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_293.wav|241|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_308.wav|241|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_078.wav|241|I've got the shirt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_287.wav|241|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_002.wav|241|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_234.wav|241|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_144.wav|241|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_372.wav|241|By that time, however, it was already too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_329.wav|241|I've not thought about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_059.wav|241|There was a battle there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_090.wav|241|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_215.wav|241|We want to keep the pound.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_023.wav|241|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_353.wav|241|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_165.wav|241|There was no respite.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_171.wav|241|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_347.wav|241|I got a yellow card.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_037.wav|241|It's nice to hear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_084.wav|241|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_127.wav|241|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_311.wav|241|I was rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_061.wav|241|It was all in a short period of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_257.wav|241|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_243.wav|241|The scene is about this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_075.wav|241|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_305.wav|241|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_133.wav|241|It's not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_149.wav|241|We want to see the maximum of change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_180.wav|241|They know no other way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_239.wav|241|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_262.wav|241|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_112.wav|241|The breakdown was much later in her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_324.wav|241|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_168.wav|241|Waiting times for these services are too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_218.wav|241|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_330.wav|241|Who was the mystery MP?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_106.wav|241|I'm not depressed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_276.wav|241|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_089.wav|241|They have not done so this season so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_040.wav|241|President Bush is at war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_083.wav|241|Nothing is yet confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_176.wav|241|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_340.wav|241|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_030.wav|241|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_206.wav|241|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_212.wav|241|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_024.wav|241|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_354.wav|241|As, indeed, they would be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_162.wav|241|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_118.wav|241|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_268.wav|241|And Michael was just great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_005.wav|241|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_233.wav|241|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_143.wav|241|Is that Titanic?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_139.wav|241|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_280.wav|241|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_249.wav|241|This is the culture change in medicine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_294.wav|241|What has altered?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_157.wav|241|It was so new, so exciting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_227.wav|241|The track is currently covered in snow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_011.wav|241|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_337.wav|241|I must make that clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_101.wav|241|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_271.wav|241|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_047.wav|241|As she explains.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_359.wav|241|So I left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_029.wav|241|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_053.wav|241|However the drama was still not at an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_265.wav|241|It's very nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_115.wav|241|He will emerge as a world leader.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_323.wav|241|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_187.wav|241|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_008.wav|241|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_244.wav|241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_072.wav|241|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_302.wav|241|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_134.wav|241|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_120.wav|241|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_066.wav|241|Try to save us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_250.wav|241|Her presence was almost everywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_299.wav|241|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_193.wav|241|Off I went.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_079.wav|241|This is the way things should be handled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_286.wav|241|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_309.wav|241|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_145.wav|241|I am just trying to do my job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_373.wav|241|Talks are progressing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_003.wav|241|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_235.wav|241|We were extremely poor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_221.wav|241|You have to do your research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_017.wav|241|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_198.wav|241|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_151.wav|241|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_292.wav|241|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_036.wav|241|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_200.wav|241|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_170.wav|241|He was a crazy man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_346.wav|241|His contract was then not renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_085.wav|241|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_058.wav|241|I was an athlete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_091.wav|241|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_328.wav|241|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_352.wav|241|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_164.wav|241|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_214.wav|241|It's been a good year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_304.wav|241|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_132.wav|241|What will happen then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_242.wav|241|In fact, we were all over the shop.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_074.wav|241|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_238.wav|241|It is hard won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_148.wav|241|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_181.wav|241|It is minute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_195.wav|241|It's the same old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_256.wav|241|They are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_126.wav|241|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_310.wav|241|It was a question of patience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_277.wav|241|We are a grandmother.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_088.wav|241|And rugby fans can help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_041.wav|241|It was ugly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_331.wav|241|It's been hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_107.wav|241|It was his job to check.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_113.wav|241|It's not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_325.wav|241|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_055.wav|241|Next league matches Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_219.wav|241|IT S the real thing, for sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_169.wav|241|It is too much for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_297.wav|241|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_068.wav|241|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_224.wav|241|But it will be sorted out this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_012.wav|241|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_362.wav|241|This is a club on the rise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_154.wav|241|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_189.wav|241|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_140.wav|241|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_006.wav|241|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_230.wav|241|It is not the message alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_283.wav|241|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_357.wav|241|Our numbers are small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_161.wav|241|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_211.wav|241|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_027.wav|241|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_094.wav|241|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_049.wav|241|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_080.wav|241|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_033.wav|241|People love to see this stuff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_205.wav|241|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_175.wav|241|And I saw the light!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_343.wav|241|Tiger is the exception.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_065.wav|241|He could make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_253.wav|241|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_123.wav|241|I'm so angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_315.wav|241|The home team had an amazing start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_159.wav|241|I've put my own money into this project.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_190.wav|241|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_229.wav|241|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_184.wav|241|We did everything by the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_301.wav|241|This is a war over our home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_137.wav|241|It was typical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_247.wav|241|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_071.wav|241|He highlighted a lack of staff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_116.wav|241|I'm delighted about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_320.wav|241|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_099.wav|241|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_050.wav|241|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_266.wav|241|It left me with a sadness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_272.wav|241|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_044.wav|241|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_334.wav|241|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_102.wav|241|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_178.wav|241|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_208.wav|241|I don't want to use it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_092.wav|241|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_217.wav|241|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_021.wav|241|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_351.wav|241|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_167.wav|241|The post will be unpaid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_173.wav|241|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_345.wav|241|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_035.wav|241|He took me on a tour of the wards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_203.wav|241|He's not perfect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_279.wav|241|I saw it at a ruck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_109.wav|241|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_364.wav|241|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_152.wav|241|They were later discharged from hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_222.wav|241|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_014.wav|241|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_291.wav|241|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_258.wav|241|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_128.wav|241|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_285.wav|241|The death toll included five children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_236.wav|241|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_146.wav|241|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_370.wav|241|Safety was also an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_056.wav|241|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_260.wav|241|It was good fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_110.wav|241|We want to help them through it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_326.wav|241|We agreed to disagree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_038.wav|241|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_332.wav|241|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_104.wav|241|They will want to perform well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_274.wav|241|It was a privilege to work for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_042.wav|241|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_019.wav|241|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_196.wav|241|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_369.wav|241|There was no hint of scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_125.wav|241|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_313.wav|241|It should be equal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_063.wav|241|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_255.wav|241|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_241.wav|241|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_288.wav|241|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_077.wav|241|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_307.wav|241|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_182.wav|241|They will run a mile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_007.wav|241|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_231.wav|241|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_188.wav|241|I wish I could say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_141.wav|241|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_282.wav|241|Yet, it worked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_296.wav|241|It just came into my head that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_069.wav|241|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_319.wav|241|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_363.wav|241|Equity declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_155.wav|241|Was this element always there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_225.wav|241|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_013.wav|241|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_048.wav|241|He is too weak to move.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_081.wav|241|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_338.wav|241|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_174.wav|241|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_342.wav|241|I would miss him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_032.wav|241|This is the window.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_204.wav|241|They've got three-quarters of the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_210.wav|241|He knows a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_026.wav|241|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_356.wav|241|It benefits the whole family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_160.wav|241|We do not get that impression now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_095.wav|241|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_185.wav|241|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_246.wav|241|They are different types.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_070.wav|241|The company yesterday refused to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_300.wav|241|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_136.wav|241|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_122.wav|241|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_314.wav|241|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_064.wav|241|The script was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_252.wav|241|Special measures were needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_228.wav|241|Who would be right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_158.wav|241|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_191.wav|241|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_103.wav|241|We want to get to the final, anyway.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_273.wav|241|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_045.wav|241|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_209.wav|241|But I am a worried man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_179.wav|241|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_098.wav|241|I love the Dome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_051.wav|241|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_267.wav|241|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_117.wav|241|I joined a group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_321.wav|241|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_034.wav|241|And we have a singer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_202.wav|241|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_172.wav|241|It became a book by itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_344.wav|241|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_108.wav|241|Is that right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_087.wav|241|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_278.wav|241|We have to break that cycle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_093.wav|241|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_350.wav|241|There is a cup final at stake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_166.wav|241|They will do their own thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_216.wav|241|I was so nervous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_284.wav|241|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_147.wav|241|The home side didn't stand a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_371.wav|241|Well, the big day has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_001.wav|241|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_237.wav|241|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_223.wav|241|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_365.wav|241|The play is based on a real-life event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_153.wav|241|Neither side can win this war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_129.wav|241|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_290.wav|241|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_259.wav|241|That's the only thing I will say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_349.wav|241|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_039.wav|241|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_275.wav|241|It's so awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_043.wav|241|That period was a struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_333.wav|241|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_105.wav|241|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_111.wav|241|It's not a new concept in jazz.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_327.wav|241|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_057.wav|241|What was the main difference?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_261.wav|241|It looks as though he will be right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_306.wav|241|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_130.wav|241|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_240.wav|241|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_289.wav|241|It changed my life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_076.wav|241|He is now resident in England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_183.wav|241|Four policemen were wounded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_197.wav|241|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_368.wav|241|He put some colour into Scottish history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_018.wav|241|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_062.wav|241|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_254.wav|241|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_124.wav|241|It has removed a bit of guilt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p241/p241_312.wav|241|Kids are terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_392.wav|243|Five years ago its return was rejected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_098.wav|243|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_051.wav|243|I'm as fit as I can get.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_267.wav|243|The board do not own the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_117.wav|243|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_321.wav|243|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_335.wav|243|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_103.wav|243|We were under a bit of pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_273.wav|243|I think I was about four years old.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_045.wav|243|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_209.wav|243|They are a victim of their own success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_386.wav|243|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_179.wav|243|Nato has left them with no other option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_122.wav|243|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_314.wav|243|He felt too close to head office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_064.wav|243|It also has a good labour supply.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_252.wav|243|The rise has come too late for some.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_228.wav|243|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_158.wav|243|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_191.wav|243|You are not long home from work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_185.wav|243|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_246.wav|243|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_070.wav|243|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_300.wav|243|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_136.wav|243|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_210.wav|243|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_026.wav|243|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_356.wav|243|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_160.wav|243|A progress report will be published in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_095.wav|243|He will be a very hard act to follow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_048.wav|243|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_081.wav|243|I do not attempt to answer that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_338.wav|243|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_174.wav|243|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_342.wav|243|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_032.wav|243|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_204.wav|243|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_296.wav|243|The strong performance is expected to continue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_069.wav|243|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_319.wav|243|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_363.wav|243|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_155.wav|243|Time may already have run out for this option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_225.wav|243|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_013.wav|243|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_007.wav|243|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_231.wav|243|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_188.wav|243|I didn't miss the big house at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_141.wav|243|I am not under any new pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_377.wav|243|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_282.wav|243|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_197.wav|243|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_368.wav|243|It was a goal which came from nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_018.wav|243|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_062.wav|243|The referee is there to decide these things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_254.wav|243|I'd rather play well next week than here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_312.wav|243|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_306.wav|243|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_130.wav|243|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_240.wav|243|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_289.wav|243|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_076.wav|243|It had little effect on European equity markets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_183.wav|243|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_111.wav|243|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_327.wav|243|I try to be open to experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_057.wav|243|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_261.wav|243|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_394.wav|243|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_380.wav|243|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_349.wav|243|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_039.wav|243|She will get through it I'm sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_275.wav|243|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_043.wav|243|He too started on the subs seats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_333.wav|243|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_105.wav|243|I bought a flat six years ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_223.wav|243|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_015.wav|243|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_365.wav|243|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_153.wav|243|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_129.wav|243|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_290.wav|243|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_259.wav|243|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_284.wav|243|The fans pay for their season tickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_147.wav|243|You should feel involved in their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_371.wav|243|We have been going for three years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_001.wav|243|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_237.wav|243|He has worked for several years in the United States.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_093.wav|243|They had the appeal of TV stars.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_350.wav|243|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_166.wav|243|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_216.wav|243|I am not going to judge them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_020.wav|243|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_034.wav|243|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_202.wav|243|I've never had a year like this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_172.wav|243|He said some things which were better left alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_344.wav|243|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_108.wav|243|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_087.wav|243|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_278.wav|243|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_272.wav|243|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_044.wav|243|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_334.wav|243|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_102.wav|243|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_387.wav|243|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_178.wav|243|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_208.wav|243|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_393.wav|243|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_116.wav|243|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_320.wav|243|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_099.wav|243|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_050.wav|243|Have I really come to this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_266.wav|243|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_184.wav|243|We have come a long way since then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_301.wav|243|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_137.wav|243|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_247.wav|243|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_071.wav|243|It turned me against the whole system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_065.wav|243|Indeed he has a lot of output.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_253.wav|243|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_123.wav|243|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_315.wav|243|If you believe in the blue and white.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_159.wav|243|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_190.wav|243|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_229.wav|243|I want to see as much progress as possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_339.wav|243|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_049.wav|243|Has the conflict started?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_080.wav|243|They said our costs were too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_033.wav|243|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_205.wav|243|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_175.wav|243|It didn't come as any great surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_343.wav|243|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_357.wav|243|It is the only natural British site on the list.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_161.wav|243|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_211.wav|243|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_027.wav|243|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_094.wav|243|There is no issue of national security involved here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_189.wav|243|The story was not made public by this club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_140.wav|243|There was only one living room, you see.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_376.wav|243|It used to be all hard sell.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_006.wav|243|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_230.wav|243|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_283.wav|243|He may be ready for first team action in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_318.wav|243|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_297.wav|243|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_068.wav|243|But it was not all bad news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_224.wav|243|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_012.wav|243|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_362.wav|243|He's young enough and he must learn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_154.wav|243|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_241.wav|243|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_288.wav|243|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_077.wav|243|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_131.wav|243|He's got to look after himself now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_182.wav|243|She is believed to be in South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_019.wav|243|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_196.wav|243|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_369.wav|243|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_125.wav|243|I think there's not much between them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_313.wav|243|For that reason cover should not be given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_063.wav|243|There were no details of the other five victims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_255.wav|243|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_038.wav|243|He added that her comments were noted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_381.wav|243|This is not a small amount of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_348.wav|243|And that is the bottom line - box office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_332.wav|243|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_104.wav|243|They won't actually make any money from it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_274.wav|243|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_042.wav|243|He does not even trust his own members.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_056.wav|243|They seem too much of a sure thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_260.wav|243|And they never show the same film as a rival.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_110.wav|243|Some young girls also came by last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_326.wav|243|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_395.wav|243|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_236.wav|243|That is the last thing they need.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_146.wav|243|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_370.wav|243|I have come here to show support for the families.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_364.wav|243|Both players gave so much to the side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_152.wav|243|Did it work?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_222.wav|243|We are still seeking that complete performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_014.wav|243|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_291.wav|243|He would get into any world team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_258.wav|243|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_128.wav|243|We have to offer value for money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_173.wav|243|If successful, several records will be made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_345.wav|243|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_035.wav|243|It is about control of our economy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_203.wav|243|Full details are expected to be released in June.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_086.wav|243|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_279.wav|243|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_109.wav|243|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_092.wav|243|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_217.wav|243|I do not see this so much as failure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_021.wav|243|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_398.wav|243|People have a wish to charge twice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_167.wav|243|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_120.wav|243|It is the right package for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_316.wav|243|A report on their property is due within days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_066.wav|243|Do not give your details to anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_250.wav|243|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_299.wav|243|He could understand both points of view.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_193.wav|243|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_378.wav|243|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_187.wav|243|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_008.wav|243|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_244.wav|243|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_072.wav|243|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_302.wav|243|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_134.wav|243|There is no future in rock music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_390.wav|243|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_359.wav|243|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_029.wav|243|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_053.wav|243|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_265.wav|243|His condition was described as serious last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_115.wav|243|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_323.wav|243|We still think this trade is on the increase.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_337.wav|243|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_101.wav|243|We are already seeing some positive results.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_271.wav|243|That's been the difference between the sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_047.wav|243|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_384.wav|243|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_294.wav|243|The agreement remains the only show in town.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_361.wav|243|The institute board will take the decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_157.wav|243|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_227.wav|243|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_011.wav|243|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_005.wav|243|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_233.wav|243|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_143.wav|243|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_375.wav|243|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_139.wav|243|The programme has been made with great care.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_280.wav|243|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_249.wav|243|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_212.wav|243|It is going to change the world.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_024.wav|243|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_354.wav|243|Friday night was a pretty good night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_162.wav|243|That will reduce my chance of selection.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_118.wav|243|The idea is the shop within a shop.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_268.wav|243|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_097.wav|243|Put simply, it goes something like this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_083.wav|243|That kind of growth is the important thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_176.wav|243|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_340.wav|243|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_389.wav|243|He remains a main board director of Royal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_030.wav|243|She brought a lot to my life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_206.wav|243|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_113.wav|243|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_325.wav|243|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_055.wav|243|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_263.wav|243|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_219.wav|243|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_169.wav|243|We had to work very hard for our points.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_396.wav|243|We are keen to see truth and justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_382.wav|243|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_277.wav|243|I think the shares are good value.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_088.wav|243|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_041.wav|243|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_331.wav|243|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_107.wav|243|They are a different team at home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_195.wav|243|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_060.wav|243|It was a day she thought she would never see.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_256.wav|243|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_126.wav|243|So I am going in the right direction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_310.wav|243|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_304.wav|243|Had I heard?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_132.wav|243|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_242.wav|243|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_074.wav|243|But two groups refused to sign up.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_238.wav|243|The children were later able to leave by bus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_148.wav|243|It is open season on the Old Firm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_181.wav|243|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_058.wav|243|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_091.wav|243|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_328.wav|243|He is not exactly a pretty child.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_352.wav|243|Sales will begin by the end of October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_164.wav|243|Surely it can't run for two years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_214.wav|243|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_022.wav|243|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_036.wav|243|Each brand was owned by a different family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_200.wav|243|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_170.wav|243|That is a big risk at any price.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_346.wav|243|It was a bit like having children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_085.wav|243|No plan for projects are yet in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_221.wav|243|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_367.wav|243|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_198.wav|243|But they had to be paid for.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_151.wav|243|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_292.wav|243|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_079.wav|243|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_286.wav|243|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_309.wav|243|It happened on average once a week this year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_145.wav|243|All eight victims were based in Germany.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_373.wav|243|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_003.wav|243|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_235.wav|243|You are not allowed to do that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_009.wav|243|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_379.wav|243|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_186.wav|243|A great player has to win major championships.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_303.wav|243|Are you from the rugby?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_135.wav|243|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_245.wav|243|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_073.wav|243|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_067.wav|243|He was failed by his health authority.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_251.wav|243|However, the figures tell a different story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_298.wav|243|It is based on population rather than need.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_121.wav|243|They have no real friends in the region.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_317.wav|243|He will just go on doing his job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_192.wav|243|I am fighting the force of nature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_270.wav|243|Its primary business channel is the internet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_046.wav|243|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_336.wav|243|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_100.wav|243|I am delighted to hear this news.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_385.wav|243|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_028.wav|243|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_391.wav|243|My tax affairs have been totally open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_358.wav|243|His style was direct and very human.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_114.wav|243|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_322.wav|243|We will not simply hit these people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_052.wav|243|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_264.wav|243|The two companies were not for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_142.wav|243|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_374.wav|243|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_004.wav|243|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_232.wav|243|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_281.wav|243|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_248.wav|243|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_138.wav|243|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_295.wav|243|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_226.wav|243|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_010.wav|243|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_360.wav|243|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_156.wav|243|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_082.wav|243|It's been a great evening for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_031.wav|243|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_207.wav|243|I want an answer from the British Government.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_177.wav|243|It's just a different way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_341.wav|243|Put another way, they just won't do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_388.wav|243|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_355.wav|243|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_163.wav|243|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_213.wav|243|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_025.wav|243|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_269.wav|243|They always want to give a performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_096.wav|243|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_119.wav|243|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_383.wav|243|I just felt that I was broken down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_330.wav|243|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_106.wav|243|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_276.wav|243|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_089.wav|243|I feel I did not have enough time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_040.wav|243|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_054.wav|243|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_262.wav|243|There would be a north and south division.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_112.wav|243|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_324.wav|243|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_168.wav|243|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_397.wav|243|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_218.wav|243|A European final must be the millennium target.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_243.wav|243|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_075.wav|243|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_305.wav|243|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_133.wav|243|No country has a similar training programme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_149.wav|243|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_180.wav|243|I am secure in my own position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_239.wav|243|Jim was down there with his wife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_194.wav|243|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_127.wav|243|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_311.wav|243|He is keen to stay in public service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_061.wav|243|Talks have continued at many different levels.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_257.wav|243|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_171.wav|243|You need a long-term strategy in football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_347.wav|243|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_037.wav|243|That was not perfect golf by any means.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_201.wav|243|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_084.wav|243|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_329.wav|243|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_059.wav|243|We just want this season to end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_090.wav|243|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_215.wav|243|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_023.wav|243|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_353.wav|243|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_165.wav|243|But the game is still wide open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_308.wav|243|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_078.wav|243|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_287.wav|243|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_002.wav|243|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_234.wav|243|The labour side has developed in the North area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_144.wav|243|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_372.wav|243|He really played us into a corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_366.wav|243|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_199.wav|243|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_150.wav|243|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_220.wav|243|I was independent but I am not now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_016.wav|243|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p243/p243_293.wav|243|They first met during a Step in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_093.wav|244|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_399.wav|244|I want this one to be different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_350.wav|244|This isn't the end of story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_166.wav|244|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_216.wav|244|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_020.wav|244|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_034.wav|244|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_172.wav|244|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_344.wav|244|And the context is also completely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_422.wav|244|I am delighted for them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_108.wav|244|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_087.wav|244|It would have been around the turn of the century.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_278.wav|244|However, the matter is not going to end there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_223.wav|244|Because he was born in England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_015.wav|244|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_365.wav|244|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_153.wav|244|Others are expected to follow the lead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_129.wav|244|He wanted to record the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_403.wav|244|He is a quality player.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_259.wav|244|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_290.wav|244|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_284.wav|244|It is important that he is involved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_417.wav|244|It had been on the cards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_147.wav|244|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_371.wav|244|I have a good feeling about this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_001.wav|244|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_237.wav|244|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_111.wav|244|There, you were just a body.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_327.wav|244|He is already in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_057.wav|244|Clearly, they had other problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_261.wav|244|But it was a loss.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_394.wav|244|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_349.wav|244|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_380.wav|244|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_039.wav|244|She was there for the start of the campaign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_275.wav|244|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_043.wav|244|Something has to be put in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_333.wav|244|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_105.wav|244|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_197.wav|244|That you can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_368.wav|244|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_018.wav|244|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_062.wav|244|The company continues to grow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_254.wav|244|I was never in danger.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_124.wav|244|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_312.wav|244|In that moment, I was happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_306.wav|244|It will be done in stages.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_130.wav|244|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_240.wav|244|This is a fight to the death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_076.wav|244|She did that for the rest of her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_183.wav|244|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_296.wav|244|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_069.wav|244|It was an outstanding performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_319.wav|244|Look at the potential of this club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_405.wav|244|It's all been about the basics of the business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_363.wav|244|At first, the youngster was not keen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_155.wav|244|It was all for good reason as well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_225.wav|244|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_013.wav|244|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_007.wav|244|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_231.wav|244|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_141.wav|244|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_188.wav|244|That is a question for the next manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_377.wav|244|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_411.wav|244|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_282.wav|244|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_210.wav|244|As many as the market will support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_026.wav|244|It may be good for the soul.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_356.wav|244|However, it does not tell the full story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_160.wav|244|We want to get there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_095.wav|244|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_081.wav|244|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_048.wav|244|In fact, they are the future of investment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_424.wav|244|But it was a struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_338.wav|244|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_174.wav|244|Like the others, he was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_342.wav|244|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_032.wav|244|The end result is the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_204.wav|244|It is not an issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_408.wav|244|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_122.wav|244|He was not alone at the top of the board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_314.wav|244|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_064.wav|244|We felt it was sufficient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_252.wav|244|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_228.wav|244|We want this place to work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_191.wav|244|It is simply not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_158.wav|244|As for the warning, it was not needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_185.wav|244|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_246.wav|244|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_070.wav|244|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_300.wav|244|Scotland won by six wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_136.wav|244|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_392.wav|244|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_051.wav|244|In my view, it has to be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_098.wav|244|It took an option on the process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_267.wav|244|But we were in control at that point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_117.wav|244|This is a sea change in approach.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_321.wav|244|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_335.wav|244|And it's a goodbye from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_103.wav|244|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_273.wav|244|I am still waiting for a reply.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_045.wav|244|They are going after them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_209.wav|244|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_386.wav|244|An announcement is expected this week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_179.wav|244|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_173.wav|244|We were all over the place in the first half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_345.wav|244|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_035.wav|244|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_203.wav|244|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_086.wav|244|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_279.wav|244|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_423.wav|244|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_109.wav|244|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_092.wav|244|It sounds a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_217.wav|244|I'm interested in interesting work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_398.wav|244|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_351.wav|244|He is a great prospect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_167.wav|244|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_416.wav|244|There is no need to panic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_285.wav|244|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_236.wav|244|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_146.wav|244|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_370.wav|244|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_364.wav|244|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_152.wav|244|It starts at the top.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_222.wav|244|He was not injured in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_014.wav|244|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_258.wav|244|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_291.wav|244|None of the agencies was able to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_128.wav|244|It was far from business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_402.wav|244|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_038.wav|244|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_348.wav|244|We never played at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_381.wav|244|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_104.wav|244|The trick is to try it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_274.wav|244|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_042.wav|244|And they had a case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_056.wav|244|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_260.wav|244|That is not the case in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_110.wav|244|Then again, we could have.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_326.wav|244|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_395.wav|244|One-third of the places are already taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_288.wav|244|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_241.wav|244|All will be revealed in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_077.wav|244|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_307.wav|244|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_131.wav|244|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_182.wav|244|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_019.wav|244|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_196.wav|244|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_369.wav|244|However, it was well worth the wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_125.wav|244|We had a great time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_313.wav|244|All of the management has invested in the firm.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_063.wav|244|He said it was for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_255.wav|244|A lot has been written.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_140.wav|244|Are you from the rugby?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_189.wav|244|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_376.wav|244|You have to be patient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_006.wav|244|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_230.wav|244|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_283.wav|244|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_410.wav|244|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_318.wav|244|We have to be very, very careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_404.wav|244|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_297.wav|244|How independent is that?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_068.wav|244|He has not been dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_224.wav|244|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_012.wav|244|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_362.wav|244|The parents will have a great time, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_154.wav|244|She does not want to speak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_339.wav|244|Like many companies, it is a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_080.wav|244|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_049.wav|244|That is still the case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_033.wav|244|It is on the internet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_205.wav|244|They have to get that sorted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_175.wav|244|All the pressure was on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_343.wav|244|Something is going to have to give.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_357.wav|244|They were impressive against France.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_161.wav|244|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_211.wav|244|He is believed to live in Britain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_027.wav|244|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_094.wav|244|It is not a story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_184.wav|244|It should never have happened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_301.wav|244|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_137.wav|244|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_247.wav|244|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_071.wav|244|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_065.wav|244|That is all in the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_253.wav|244|Instead, he missed the lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_409.wav|244|They are not going the length of the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_123.wav|244|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_315.wav|244|They were not at the property yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_190.wav|244|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_159.wav|244|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_229.wav|244|It still has an effect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_272.wav|244|He must have a crack at it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_044.wav|244|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_334.wav|244|Tax is a matter for national governments.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_102.wav|244|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_387.wav|244|He will be difficult to replace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_178.wav|244|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_208.wav|244|It was the story of the second half.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_393.wav|244|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_116.wav|244|In the end we have to take a stand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_320.wav|244|Hopefully, this week will be good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_050.wav|244|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_099.wav|244|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_266.wav|244|It depends on Labour, not on us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_221.wav|244|It was important to win today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_017.wav|244|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_367.wav|244|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_151.wav|244|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_198.wav|244|I would like to continue to develop.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_401.wav|244|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_292.wav|244|I didn't see the point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_079.wav|244|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_286.wav|244|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_415.wav|244|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_309.wav|244|But it is a similar problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_145.wav|244|Actors like to be in the centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_373.wav|244|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_003.wav|244|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_235.wav|244|We have to win the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_091.wav|244|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_058.wav|244|This trend is likely to strengthen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_328.wav|244|Another difference is the cost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_352.wav|244|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_164.wav|244|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_214.wav|244|This conference was never confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_022.wav|244|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_036.wav|244|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_200.wav|244|He has defended the system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_170.wav|244|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_346.wav|244|The banking sector was weak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_420.wav|244|That might mean another delay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_085.wav|244|It starts with the script.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_195.wav|244|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_060.wav|244|We have got to deliver.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_256.wav|244|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_126.wav|244|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_310.wav|244|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_304.wav|244|Every one is a winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_418.wav|244|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_132.wav|244|It is hard to believe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_242.wav|244|He is a man of the people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_074.wav|244|Only water is currently allowed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_238.wav|244|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_181.wav|244|I was always in control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_148.wav|244|I am the manager of Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_113.wav|244|He is not a dancer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_325.wav|244|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_055.wav|244|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_263.wav|244|The performance continues to improve.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_219.wav|244|THE force is with them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_169.wav|244|Anyone can do the sums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_396.wav|244|I understand the frustration of the fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_382.wav|244|It's fantastic to win again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_277.wav|244|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_041.wav|244|In London today, it was business as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_088.wav|244|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_331.wav|244|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_107.wav|244|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_212.wav|244|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_024.wav|244|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_354.wav|244|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_162.wav|244|There is a lack of staff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_118.wav|244|Otherwise, the market may come back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_268.wav|244|It has to be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_097.wav|244|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_083.wav|244|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_176.wav|244|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_389.wav|244|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_340.wav|244|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_030.wav|244|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_206.wav|244|We can take the city.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_294.wav|244|We are in a war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_407.wav|244|It's great that it happened in Britain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_361.wav|244|Either team will be hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_157.wav|244|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_227.wav|244|However, it is not as simple as this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_011.wav|244|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_005.wav|244|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_233.wav|244|There is a lot of concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_143.wav|244|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_375.wav|244|It is almost certain to be the last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_139.wav|244|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_413.wav|244|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_249.wav|244|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_280.wav|244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_359.wav|244|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_390.wav|244|He was on a mission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_029.wav|244|It is about investing in the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_053.wav|244|Their campaign is in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_265.wav|244|However, no further action was taken by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_115.wav|244|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_323.wav|244|But it is up again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_337.wav|244|They have to be addressed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_101.wav|244|On Saturday, it was much the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_271.wav|244|But the government has so far failed to listen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_047.wav|244|The whole thing is the music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_384.wav|244|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_120.wav|244|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_316.wav|244|It involved the same people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_066.wav|244|There is a lot to be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_299.wav|244|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_250.wav|244|Sadly, it could not be done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_193.wav|244|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_378.wav|244|I was delighted to accept.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_187.wav|244|It is difficult to say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_008.wav|244|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_244.wav|244|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_072.wav|244|It is only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_302.wav|244|This is a historic agreement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_134.wav|244|Three days later, he was killed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_414.wav|244|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_308.wav|244|Every character was completely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_078.wav|244|That will be the office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_287.wav|244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_002.wav|244|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_234.wav|244|It will be decided in the next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_144.wav|244|I have been in contact with him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_372.wav|244|The news is not all bad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_366.wav|244|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_150.wav|244|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_199.wav|244|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_220.wav|244|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_016.wav|244|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_293.wav|244|This idea has been around for four years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_400.wav|244|It is the last meeting of the season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_171.wav|244|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_347.wav|244|But the New Year was special.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_037.wav|244|History is in the making.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_201.wav|244|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_084.wav|244|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_421.wav|244|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_329.wav|244|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_090.wav|244|It seems a good thing to try.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_059.wav|244|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_215.wav|244|A team is a team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_023.wav|244|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_353.wav|244|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_165.wav|244|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_243.wav|244|The matter is under appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_075.wav|244|This time, it might be for real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_305.wav|244|There was a hole in it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_419.wav|244|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_133.wav|244|Or it would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_180.wav|244|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_149.wav|244|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_239.wav|244|There was a lot of resentment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_194.wav|244|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_127.wav|244|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_311.wav|244|But it is important for a number of reasons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_061.wav|244|That was the difference today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_257.wav|244|It was really good in the first week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_383.wav|244|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_330.wav|244|And we can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_106.wav|244|Victory was never in doubt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_276.wav|244|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_040.wav|244|She was at the top.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_089.wav|244|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_054.wav|244|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_262.wav|244|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_112.wav|244|But he has not become a monster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_324.wav|244|However, the devil is in the detail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_168.wav|244|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_397.wav|244|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_218.wav|244|It decided to blame the media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_082.wav|244|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_031.wav|244|They were in good humour, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_207.wav|244|He played it like a veteran.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_177.wav|244|They have not been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_388.wav|244|I would be interested in another attempt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_341.wav|244|However, a bid was never made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_355.wav|244|This latter suggestion is very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_163.wav|244|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_213.wav|244|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_025.wav|244|We are a service industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_269.wav|244|The party has never fully recovered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_096.wav|244|He is in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_119.wav|244|The procedures were not in place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_142.wav|244|That was the first step.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_374.wav|244|However, it does not seem to be the case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_004.wav|244|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_232.wav|244|Other villages were completely deserted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_248.wav|244|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_281.wav|244|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_138.wav|244|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_412.wav|244|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_406.wav|244|There is a demand for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_295.wav|244|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_226.wav|244|I was not overly concerned about this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_010.wav|244|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_360.wav|244|It was a test in itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_156.wav|244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_270.wav|244|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_046.wav|244|It is all about the story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_336.wav|244|It is a sensitive issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_100.wav|244|This is a game of confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_385.wav|244|Everything is in the mix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_028.wav|244|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_358.wav|244|The challenge is to win a cup.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_391.wav|244|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_114.wav|244|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_322.wav|244|We did something about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_052.wav|244|The pressure on the players will build.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_264.wav|244|It expected this trend to continue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_009.wav|244|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_379.wav|244|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_186.wav|244|The feeling is hard to describe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_303.wav|244|We have to be realistic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_135.wav|244|Football is a passion for many.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_245.wav|244|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_073.wav|244|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_067.wav|244|But that's another story for another day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_298.wav|244|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_251.wav|244|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_121.wav|244|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_317.wav|244|We want to get back into the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p244/p244_192.wav|244|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_156.wav|245|The hotel was now for sale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_226.wav|245|It's quite a line-up!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_010.wav|245|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_295.wav|245|Nothing is safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_138.wav|245|Mr Blair had done well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_248.wav|245|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_281.wav|245|He was obviously very genuine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_004.wav|245|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_232.wav|245|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_142.wav|245|Was this element always there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_119.wav|245|Who will attend?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_269.wav|245|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_096.wav|245|No date has been set for the appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_213.wav|245|It was good fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_025.wav|245|Johnson was pretty low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_355.wav|245|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_163.wav|245|We did everything by the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_177.wav|245|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_341.wav|245|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_031.wav|245|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_207.wav|245|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_082.wav|245|It's never too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_192.wav|245|We don't even know his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_121.wav|245|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_317.wav|245|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_067.wav|245|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_298.wav|245|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_251.wav|245|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_245.wav|245|This year I understood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_073.wav|245|This is the way things should be handled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_303.wav|245|You are the glory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_135.wav|245|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_186.wav|245|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_009.wav|245|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_264.wav|245|It left me with a sadness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_114.wav|245|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_322.wav|245|The boat was fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_358.wav|245|He's very explosive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_028.wav|245|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_336.wav|245|Action is needed now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_100.wav|245|I was angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_270.wav|245|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_046.wav|245|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_353.wav|245|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_165.wav|245|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_215.wav|245|It's so special.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_023.wav|245|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_090.wav|245|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_059.wav|245|There will be tough opponents to this report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_329.wav|245|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_084.wav|245|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_037.wav|245|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_201.wav|245|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_171.wav|245|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_347.wav|245|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_293.wav|245|There was no hint of scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_220.wav|245|They had no children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_016.wav|245|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_150.wav|245|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_199.wav|245|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_144.wav|245|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_002.wav|245|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_234.wav|245|It's only fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_078.wav|245|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_287.wav|245|That could change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_308.wav|245|This is the culture change in medicine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_218.wav|245|My wife and family are the support system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_168.wav|245|It is tough, but possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_112.wav|245|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_324.wav|245|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_054.wav|245|They had to explain it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_262.wav|245|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_276.wav|245|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_040.wav|245|It's a great thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_089.wav|245|If you could find it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_330.wav|245|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_106.wav|245|Who would be a referee?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_061.wav|245|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_257.wav|245|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_127.wav|245|There is a lack of chemistry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_311.wav|245|I never thought it would take this long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_194.wav|245|He knows a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_239.wav|245|There wasn't a goal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_180.wav|245|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_149.wav|245|Nobody did in those days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_305.wav|245|We want to play at the worlds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_133.wav|245|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_243.wav|245|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_075.wav|245|What has changed?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_249.wav|245|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_280.wav|245|Well, he can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_139.wav|245|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_143.wav|245|I've learned from my mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_005.wav|245|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_233.wav|245|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_227.wav|245|I might get an injury very easily.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_011.wav|245|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_157.wav|245|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_294.wav|245|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_030.wav|245|They should be so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_206.wav|245|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_176.wav|245|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_340.wav|245|There's no place to hide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_083.wav|245|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_268.wav|245|Of course I was tempted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_097.wav|245|It was an adventure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_118.wav|245|He has been under great pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_354.wav|245|It was very formal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_162.wav|245|They will run a mile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_212.wav|245|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_024.wav|245|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_302.wav|245|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_134.wav|245|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_244.wav|245|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_072.wav|245|People must remain vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_008.wav|245|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_187.wav|245|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_193.wav|245|Feel the heat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_066.wav|245|You need a trademark.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_299.wav|245|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_250.wav|245|It is nearly there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_120.wav|245|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_316.wav|245|I am very happy to be here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_271.wav|245|She looked so young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_047.wav|245|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_337.wav|245|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_101.wav|245|That team is due to be announced this morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_115.wav|245|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_323.wav|245|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_053.wav|245|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_265.wav|245|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_029.wav|245|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_359.wav|245|But nothing happened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_085.wav|245|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_170.wav|245|The procedure is the same in all cases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_346.wav|245|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_036.wav|245|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_200.wav|245|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_214.wav|245|At the time, he was a living legend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_022.wav|245|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_352.wav|245|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_164.wav|245|It is not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_328.wav|245|The same things will happen with GM foods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_091.wav|245|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_058.wav|245|It's a matter of balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_003.wav|245|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_235.wav|245|He says that he is no different from any other man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_145.wav|245|It has to be now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_309.wav|245|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_079.wav|245|We have other options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_286.wav|245|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_292.wav|245|He has retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_151.wav|245|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_198.wav|245|It's been a good year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_221.wav|245|We are in the hat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_017.wav|245|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_331.wav|245|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_107.wav|245|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_277.wav|245|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_041.wav|245|Indeed, he does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_088.wav|245|Then came the crunch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_219.wav|245|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_055.wav|245|He had no enemies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_263.wav|245|Immediate action must be taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_113.wav|245|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_325.wav|245|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_181.wav|245|But we are not immune to the problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_148.wav|245|That will do for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_238.wav|245|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_242.wav|245|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_074.wav|245|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_304.wav|245|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_132.wav|245|They did very well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_126.wav|245|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_310.wav|245|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_060.wav|245|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_256.wav|245|I was happily surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_195.wav|245|I began to pray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_094.wav|245|We want to get to the final, anyway.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_211.wav|245|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_027.wav|245|It's nice to hear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_357.wav|245|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_161.wav|245|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_175.wav|245|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_343.wav|245|It was forced to divert.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_033.wav|245|I was an athlete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_205.wav|245|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_080.wav|245|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_049.wav|245|The boy is no longer with us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_339.wav|245|I would miss him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_154.wav|245|We wanted it left for a wee while.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_224.wav|245|It is not the message alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_012.wav|245|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_297.wav|245|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_068.wav|245|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_318.wav|245|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_283.wav|245|The weather forecast isn't good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_006.wav|245|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_230.wav|245|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_140.wav|245|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_189.wav|245|That will be vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_050.wav|245|Who can say?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_099.wav|245|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_266.wav|245|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_116.wav|245|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_320.wav|245|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_208.wav|245|He demanded to speak to the boss.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_178.wav|245|It was still there, but right at the end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_334.wav|245|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_102.wav|245|I have had no social life at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_272.wav|245|It happens from time to time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_044.wav|245|But it took a lot of bottle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_229.wav|245|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_190.wav|245|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_123.wav|245|Is that it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_315.wav|245|They had a confession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_065.wav|245|The script was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_253.wav|245|It's that kind of place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_247.wav|245|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_071.wav|245|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_301.wav|245|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_137.wav|245|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_184.wav|245|They are in the euro.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_128.wav|245|I was awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_258.wav|245|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_291.wav|245|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_222.wav|245|We were a load of rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_014.wav|245|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_152.wav|245|It became a book by itself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_146.wav|245|I was in the train station overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_236.wav|245|You can feel at home in China.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_285.wav|245|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_351.wav|245|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_167.wav|245|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_217.wav|245|I can't wait to meet him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_021.wav|245|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_092.wav|245|He's a star.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_109.wav|245|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_086.wav|245|It is a lifeline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_279.wav|245|It's very safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_035.wav|245|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_203.wav|245|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_173.wav|245|We must keep our feet on the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_345.wav|245|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_063.wav|245|He was popular.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_125.wav|245|We want to keep the pound.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_313.wav|245|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_196.wav|245|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_019.wav|245|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_182.wav|245|The red card was okay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_307.wav|245|He was solid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_131.wav|245|He will emerge as a world leader.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_288.wav|245|The goals will come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_241.wav|245|They are different types.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_077.wav|245|That is bound to happen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_110.wav|245|We work on the same level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_326.wav|245|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_056.wav|245|Sadly, it can't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_260.wav|245|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_274.wav|245|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_042.wav|245|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_332.wav|245|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_104.wav|245|I'm delighted about that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_348.wav|245|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_038.wav|245|It has failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_032.wav|245|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_204.wav|245|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_174.wav|245|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_342.wav|245|I'm very lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_338.wav|245|Indeed, it was magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_081.wav|245|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_048.wav|245|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_095.wav|245|Oil embargo endorsed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_356.wav|245|It's not that clear-cut.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_160.wav|245|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_210.wav|245|Saturday is gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_026.wav|245|But it failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_282.wav|245|It goes back a long way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_141.wav|245|He can do no wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_188.wav|245|It's all about money, money, money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_007.wav|245|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_231.wav|245|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_225.wav|245|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_013.wav|245|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_155.wav|245|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_319.wav|245|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_296.wav|245|They are wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_069.wav|245|She died in hospital two hours later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_179.wav|245|The conference is the first test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_209.wav|245|You have to do your research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_273.wav|245|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_045.wav|245|Sure, it's funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_335.wav|245|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_103.wav|245|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_117.wav|245|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_321.wav|245|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_051.wav|245|It's a blessing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_098.wav|245|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_267.wav|245|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_300.wav|245|It's just not funny!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_136.wav|245|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_246.wav|245|Her presence was almost everywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_070.wav|245|Is there a new way forward?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_185.wav|245|He's not perfect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_191.wav|245|It's like a garage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_158.wav|245|Everyone can be bought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_228.wav|245|This fact is supported by audience research.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_064.wav|245|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_252.wav|245|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_122.wav|245|What will happen then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_314.wav|245|For the moment, our position remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_001.wav|245|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_237.wav|245|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_147.wav|245|The release attracted little attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_284.wav|245|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_259.wav|245|I HAVE a dream.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_290.wav|245|This is a huge confidence boost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_129.wav|245|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_223.wav|245|They should come forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_015.wav|245|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_087.wav|245|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_278.wav|245|Yet, it worked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_108.wav|245|Who would have?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_172.wav|245|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_344.wav|245|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_034.wav|245|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_202.wav|245|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_216.wav|245|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_020.wav|245|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_350.wav|245|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_166.wav|245|I had a train to catch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_093.wav|245|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_183.wav|245|I have a cold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_289.wav|245|Sunday's game was not a trial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_240.wav|245|I was shocked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_076.wav|245|I'd like to continue that record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_306.wav|245|We have waited a long time for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_130.wav|245|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_124.wav|245|He was in a great deal of pain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_312.wav|245|They wanted the club to make money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_062.wav|245|He should have asked for a second opinion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_254.wav|245|they fail to engage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_018.wav|245|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_197.wav|245|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_333.wav|245|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_105.wav|245|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_275.wav|245|You've got to have both sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_043.wav|245|She is believed to be in South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_039.wav|245|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_349.wav|245|It is not like working for a living.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_057.wav|245|None has ever been found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_261.wav|245|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_111.wav|245|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p245/p245_327.wav|245|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_054.wav|246|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_262.wav|246|Blood samples were taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_112.wav|246|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_324.wav|246|Either team will be hard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_168.wav|246|He was a crazy man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_218.wav|246|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_330.wav|246|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_106.wav|246|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_276.wav|246|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_040.wav|246|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_089.wav|246|As, indeed, they would be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_194.wav|246|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_127.wav|246|It plans to return to this field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_311.wav|246|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_061.wav|246|It's that kind of place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_257.wav|246|I could have got out a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_243.wav|246|The scene is about this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_075.wav|246|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_305.wav|246|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_133.wav|246|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_180.wav|246|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_149.wav|246|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_239.wav|246|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_329.wav|246|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_090.wav|246|This one did.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_059.wav|246|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_215.wav|246|The report is due out next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_023.wav|246|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_353.wav|246|Hartley should know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_165.wav|246|We should do everything at a stroke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_171.wav|246|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_347.wav|246|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_037.wav|246|They're just different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_201.wav|246|I will win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_084.wav|246|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_150.wav|246|I was stunned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_199.wav|246|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_220.wav|246|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_016.wav|246|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_293.wav|246|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_308.wav|246|You are the glory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_078.wav|246|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_287.wav|246|You feel very helpless.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_002.wav|246|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_234.wav|246|You should be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_144.wav|246|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_067.wav|246|There could be a way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_298.wav|246|And huge, indeed, it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_251.wav|246|I can't get a job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_121.wav|246|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_192.wav|246|I do not own the vessel in question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_009.wav|246|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_186.wav|246|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_303.wav|246|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_135.wav|246|It seems so long since I did the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_245.wav|246|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_073.wav|246|People must remain vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_028.wav|246|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_358.wav|246|Their time has gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_114.wav|246|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_322.wav|246|Off with their heads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_052.wav|246|Here's a clue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_264.wav|246|It will be done in stages.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_270.wav|246|We're in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_046.wav|246|They said she was stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_336.wav|246|I'm very lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_100.wav|246|That would be unlawful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_295.wav|246|Bombing slaughter rejected
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_226.wav|246|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_010.wav|246|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_360.wav|246|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_156.wav|246|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_142.wav|246|I was awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_004.wav|246|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_232.wav|246|Of course I was tempted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_248.wav|246|There's the mix.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_281.wav|246|It's so awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_138.wav|246|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_355.wav|246|It is a memorial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_163.wav|246|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_213.wav|246|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_025.wav|246|He has not been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_096.wav|246|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_119.wav|246|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_082.wav|246|It is a blow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_031.wav|246|This is the window.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_207.wav|246|My neighbours are horrified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_177.wav|246|The goals were good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_341.wav|246|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_277.wav|246|They seem to get away with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_041.wav|246|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_088.wav|246|Tony Blair said as little.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_331.wav|246|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_107.wav|246|Is that right?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_113.wav|246|Who would be a referee?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_325.wav|246|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_055.wav|246|It is unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_263.wav|246|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_219.wav|246|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_169.wav|246|As we worked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_304.wav|246|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_132.wav|246|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_242.wav|246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_074.wav|246|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_238.wav|246|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_181.wav|246|It's to do with context.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_148.wav|246|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_195.wav|246|Who will pay for this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_060.wav|246|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_256.wav|246|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_126.wav|246|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_310.wav|246|The letters are going out today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_036.wav|246|It has failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_200.wav|246|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_170.wav|246|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_346.wav|246|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_085.wav|246|It will be tight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_091.wav|246|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_058.wav|246|I feel I did not have enough time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_328.wav|246|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_352.wav|246|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_164.wav|246|Again, we were lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_214.wav|246|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_022.wav|246|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_079.wav|246|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_286.wav|246|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_309.wav|246|The minister is the engineer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_145.wav|246|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_003.wav|246|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_235.wav|246|It's quite nice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_221.wav|246|I'd never seen a play about me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_017.wav|246|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_151.wav|246|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_198.wav|246|It's all about money, money, money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_292.wav|246|Yet, it worked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_187.wav|246|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_008.wav|246|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_244.wav|246|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_072.wav|246|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_302.wav|246|She is really magic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_134.wav|246|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_120.wav|246|She really suffered for her art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_316.wav|246|The election is total confusion and chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_066.wav|246|The tournament has now been cancelled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_299.wav|246|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_250.wav|246|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_193.wav|246|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_337.wav|246|Our policy is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_101.wav|246|Oil embargo endorsed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_271.wav|246|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_047.wav|246|Is a drug dealer?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_359.wav|246|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_029.wav|246|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_053.wav|246|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_265.wav|246|There is no link.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_115.wav|246|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_323.wav|246|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_005.wav|246|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_233.wav|246|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_143.wav|246|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_139.wav|246|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_249.wav|246|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_280.wav|246|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_294.wav|246|It was good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_361.wav|246|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_157.wav|246|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_227.wav|246|At the time, he was a living legend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_011.wav|246|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_083.wav|246|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_176.wav|246|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_340.wav|246|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_030.wav|246|There's a story, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_206.wav|246|I have decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_212.wav|246|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_024.wav|246|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_354.wav|246|That would help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_162.wav|246|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_118.wav|246|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_268.wav|246|We are happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_097.wav|246|They make a selective perception process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_019.wav|246|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_196.wav|246|They've got three-quarters of the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_125.wav|246|I am now unemployed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_313.wav|246|We have got no money to go anywhere.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_063.wav|246|He could make it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_255.wav|246|Is that a serious question?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_288.wav|246|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_241.wav|246|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_077.wav|246|He is in the queue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_307.wav|246|The plot is minimal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_131.wav|246|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_182.wav|246|Does this matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_056.wav|246|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_260.wav|246|There's not much money in cycling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_110.wav|246|It is so sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_326.wav|246|He scored a touchdown.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_038.wav|246|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_348.wav|246|Until they came to do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_332.wav|246|This is the last straw.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_104.wav|246|It was an adventure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_274.wav|246|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_042.wav|246|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_152.wav|246|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_222.wav|246|It's not before time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_014.wav|246|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_258.wav|246|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_291.wav|246|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_128.wav|246|It's perfectly feasible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_285.wav|246|But I've won both ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_236.wav|246|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_146.wav|246|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_092.wav|246|But I was wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_217.wav|246|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_021.wav|246|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_351.wav|246|I was in the train station overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_167.wav|246|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_173.wav|246|I drove the ball well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_345.wav|246|He had taken everything from me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_035.wav|246|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_203.wav|246|He knows a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_086.wav|246|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_279.wav|246|It is so very obvious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_109.wav|246|It was the eighties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_116.wav|246|Who would have?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_320.wav|246|I came into this world with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_050.wav|246|She looked so young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_099.wav|246|No, the equipment is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_266.wav|246|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_272.wav|246|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_044.wav|246|We will push.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_334.wav|246|I've got no secret.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_102.wav|246|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_178.wav|246|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_208.wav|246|It's not ideal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_065.wav|246|Robin Williams is very subdued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_253.wav|246|they fail to engage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_123.wav|246|I just wanted a break.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_315.wav|246|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_190.wav|246|The concerns are the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_159.wav|246|I will tell you.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_229.wav|246|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_184.wav|246|There is no openness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_301.wav|246|What has altered?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_137.wav|246|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_247.wav|246|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_071.wav|246|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_357.wav|246|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_161.wav|246|It is not like us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_211.wav|246|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_027.wav|246|Is this accurate?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_094.wav|246|I saw the whole thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_339.wav|246|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_080.wav|246|A play is a set of actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_049.wav|246|The State would provide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_033.wav|246|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_205.wav|246|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_175.wav|246|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_343.wav|246|I got a yellow card.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_318.wav|246|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_297.wav|246|No Briton has ever won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_068.wav|246|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_224.wav|246|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_012.wav|246|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_154.wav|246|She had gone to the Catholic school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_140.wav|246|He realises his mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_189.wav|246|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_006.wav|246|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_230.wav|246|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_283.wav|246|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_306.wav|246|We could easily be cut again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_130.wav|246|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_289.wav|246|Dialogue is the key.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_240.wav|246|It is hard won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_076.wav|246|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_183.wav|246|One was a lawyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_197.wav|246|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_018.wav|246|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_062.wav|246|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_254.wav|246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_124.wav|246|Twaddle is a case in point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_312.wav|246|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_349.wav|246|You must have a government and a good civil service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_039.wav|246|Indeed, he does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_275.wav|246|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_043.wav|246|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_333.wav|246|Two people were interviewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_105.wav|246|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_111.wav|246|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_327.wav|246|Is that an issue?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_057.wav|246|That's the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_261.wav|246|Souter will be back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_284.wav|246|We are a grandmother.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_147.wav|246|I am just trying to do my job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_001.wav|246|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_237.wav|246|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_223.wav|246|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_015.wav|246|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_153.wav|246|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_129.wav|246|We work well together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_259.wav|246|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_290.wav|246|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_034.wav|246|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_202.wav|246|Feel the heat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_172.wav|246|If that's the case, he will struggle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_344.wav|246|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_108.wav|246|I had some time with Aston Villa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_087.wav|246|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_278.wav|246|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_093.wav|246|It is home-grown.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_350.wav|246|The pair are very much in love.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_166.wav|246|You had to go and see him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_216.wav|246|Because they didn't want to know.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_020.wav|246|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_335.wav|246|He loved the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_103.wav|246|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_273.wav|246|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_045.wav|246|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_209.wav|246|In each case they were a goal down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_179.wav|246|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_051.wav|246|Every aspect of our play was first class.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_098.wav|246|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_267.wav|246|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_117.wav|246|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_321.wav|246|It's too horrible to think.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_185.wav|246|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_246.wav|246|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_070.wav|246|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_300.wav|246|He was at home with his pals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_136.wav|246|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_122.wav|246|It is not a U-turn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_314.wav|246|She is on a life support machine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_064.wav|246|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_252.wav|246|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_228.wav|246|My wife and family are the support system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_191.wav|246|Is that success?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_158.wav|246|I'd love to be like Peter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_081.wav|246|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_048.wav|246|There is no reason at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_338.wav|246|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_174.wav|246|Tony had arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_342.wav|246|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_032.wav|246|He was jailed for five years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_204.wav|246|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_210.wav|246|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_026.wav|246|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_160.wav|246|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_095.wav|246|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_007.wav|246|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_231.wav|246|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_141.wav|246|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_188.wav|246|It was very frightened and dirty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_282.wav|246|If not, he should go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_296.wav|246|We are not going to forget.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_069.wav|246|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_319.wav|246|They had a confession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_155.wav|246|We are on a four-year mission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_225.wav|246|But she was.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p246/p246_013.wav|246|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_472.wav|247|And it covers the spectrum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_191.wav|247|I put the drawing down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_158.wav|247|Anyone can do the sums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_228.wav|247|The transaction is not feasible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_064.wav|247|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_252.wav|247|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_408.wav|247|But they can also be managed by telephone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_122.wav|247|However, the problem is timing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_314.wav|247|Britain is going to celebrate in style.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_300.wav|247|It's all designed to speed up the service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_136.wav|247|This should begin in October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_246.wav|247|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_070.wav|247|It's not covered by the insurance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_185.wav|247|City sentiment is in his favour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_466.wav|247|I think it's a great system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_117.wav|247|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_321.wav|247|A Home Office spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_051.wav|247|We would have concerns about suspension.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_098.wav|247|He had missed a penalty against the English.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_267.wav|247|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_447.wav|247|That will be best for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_392.wav|247|Rugby has an extended run.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_386.wav|247|The pair are very much in love.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_179.wav|247|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_453.wav|247|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_209.wav|247|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_273.wav|247|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_045.wav|247|Everything is possible in football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_335.wav|247|Scotland has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_103.wav|247|She has so much to offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_429.wav|247|Such an attack is bizarre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_225.wav|247|I am considered a teenager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_013.wav|247|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_363.wav|247|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_155.wav|247|That is the ultimate revenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_319.wav|247|His appeal is instantly understood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_405.wav|247|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_296.wav|247|It's hard to see it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_069.wav|247|Only water is currently allowed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_282.wav|247|There were no problems with the crowds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_411.wav|247|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_141.wav|247|They made such decisions in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_188.wav|247|Talks are at an advanced stage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_377.wav|247|Two things were clear from the new programme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_007.wav|247|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_231.wav|247|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_095.wav|247|Potions said he would drive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_430.wav|247|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_356.wav|247|Other people had looked at it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_160.wav|247|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_210.wav|247|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_026.wav|247|Meetings will also remain private.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_032.wav|247|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_204.wav|247|They have the cash and the fire power.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_174.wav|247|The strong pound also took its toll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_342.wav|247|It is inherent in society.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_424.wav|247|Surrey police said no body had been found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_338.wav|247|It was an achievement all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_081.wav|247|She died in hospital two hours later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_048.wav|247|It had little effect on European equity markets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_441.wav|247|There is no hiding place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_394.wav|247|Theatre is not a museum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_057.wav|247|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_261.wav|247|Persuaded to change his mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_111.wav|247|Our house was very small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_327.wav|247|Job losses were also announced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_333.wav|247|The people will not be patient.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_105.wav|247|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_275.wav|247|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_043.wav|247|Among them are many criminals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_039.wav|247|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_349.wav|247|What do they want us to do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_380.wav|247|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_455.wav|247|People are so negative about the whole business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_124.wav|247|We have the mental strength.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_312.wav|247|I was there five months ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_062.wav|247|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_254.wav|247|I have received no explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_018.wav|247|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_474.wav|247|They were impressive against France.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_197.wav|247|We represent a wide range of society.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_368.wav|247|I think we'll just keep it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_183.wav|247|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_460.wav|247|The boys are mentally focused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_289.wav|247|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_240.wav|247|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_076.wav|247|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_306.wav|247|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_130.wav|247|We suffered a lot for seven years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_216.wav|247|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_020.wav|247|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_399.wav|247|Ferguson must take the blame.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_350.wav|247|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_166.wav|247|It has become a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_436.wav|247|There is another important factor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_093.wav|247|On Saturday, it was much the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_087.wav|247|I've had it for the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_278.wav|247|On the contrary they stand to gain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_422.wav|247|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_108.wav|247|We made a world record together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_458.wav|247|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_172.wav|247|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_344.wav|247|What are they for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_034.wav|247|The company did not declare a dividend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_202.wav|247|Mr Blair was ready for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_259.wav|247|You can never tell with the manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_290.wav|247|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_129.wav|247|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_403.wav|247|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_365.wav|247|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_153.wav|247|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_479.wav|247|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_223.wav|247|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_001.wav|247|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_237.wav|247|The scientific debate is dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_147.wav|247|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_371.wav|247|The members have voted against it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_417.wav|247|Shelter also supports the reform.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_284.wav|247|These figures are truly terrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_247.wav|247|I am not going to go tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_071.wav|247|Final proposals will be published in February.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_301.wav|247|We will deliver at director level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_137.wav|247|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_184.wav|247|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_467.wav|247|They're just a good retailer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_229.wav|247|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_473.wav|247|We will now look into its historical background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_190.wav|247|The Royal Highland was no exception.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_159.wav|247|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_409.wav|247|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_123.wav|247|It isn't a happy memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_315.wav|247|His job was not advertised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_065.wav|247|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_253.wav|247|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_208.wav|247|This will take several weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_387.wav|247|The team hadn't been picked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_178.wav|247|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_452.wav|247|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_334.wav|247|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_102.wav|247|But it is up again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_428.wav|247|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_272.wav|247|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_044.wav|247|Merger would be entirely logical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_050.wav|247|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_099.wav|247|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_266.wav|247|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_116.wav|247|We deserve a significant rise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_320.wav|247|I first met him last summer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_446.wav|247|It wouldn't matter if he had.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_393.wav|247|It has happened for generations.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_410.wav|247|The casualties were not named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_283.wav|247|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_006.wav|247|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_230.wav|247|William Hague delighted his party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_140.wav|247|This is the highlight of my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_189.wav|247|They bought the property four years ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_376.wav|247|That is a crazy situation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_362.wav|247|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_154.wav|247|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_224.wav|247|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_012.wav|247|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_297.wav|247|A revival is under way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_068.wav|247|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_318.wav|247|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_404.wav|247|The BBC was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_175.wav|247|The strong performance is expected to continue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_343.wav|247|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_033.wav|247|It carried a double message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_205.wav|247|The early physical reports were clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_080.wav|247|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_049.wav|247|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_425.wav|247|It was submitted without their knowledge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_339.wav|247|The election is total confusion and chaos.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_431.wav|247|No date has been fixed for his return.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_094.wav|247|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_211.wav|247|January is a bad time of year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_027.wav|247|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_357.wav|247|It was tough to contain the excitement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_161.wav|247|His second goal was equally impressive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_274.wav|247|How independent is that?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_042.wav|247|They said she was stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_332.wav|247|They come to enjoy themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_104.wav|247|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_348.wav|247|Had this been common practice?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_381.wav|247|The major championships will always have a special place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_454.wav|247|Police have appealed for witnesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_038.wav|247|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_440.wav|247|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_395.wav|247|He took over our lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_110.wav|247|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_326.wav|247|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_056.wav|247|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_260.wav|247|We have no information on Iraq.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_182.wav|247|His team management was protective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_461.wav|247|It's because they can't understand the language.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_307.wav|247|But it has been an amazing experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_131.wav|247|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_288.wav|247|None of this work is guaranteed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_241.wav|247|She was an only child.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_077.wav|247|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_063.wav|247|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_255.wav|247|Mr Smith declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_125.wav|247|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_475.wav|247|The chief constable has retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_196.wav|247|I'm interested in interesting work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_369.wav|247|It is a stroke of genius.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_019.wav|247|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_423.wav|247|That's been all around Europe with me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_109.wav|247|The following are the principal provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_086.wav|247|It makes for an interesting conference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_279.wav|247|It was a minor incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_035.wav|247|That is the face of fear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_203.wav|247|Because he was born in England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_459.wav|247|The damage is all inside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_173.wav|247|We will turn the corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_345.wav|247|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_398.wav|247|It is a simple equation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_351.wav|247|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_167.wav|247|There's always the next century.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_217.wav|247|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_021.wav|247|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_092.wav|247|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_437.wav|247|We've made a couple of albums.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_146.wav|247|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_370.wav|247|He had no access to the database.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_236.wav|247|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_285.wav|247|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_416.wav|247|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_128.wav|247|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_402.wav|247|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_258.wav|247|Labour was too busy to respond.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_291.wav|247|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_222.wav|247|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_014.wav|247|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_364.wav|247|But we welcome this document.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_152.wav|247|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_115.wav|247|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_323.wav|247|There was no hint of scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_053.wav|247|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_265.wav|247|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_029.wav|247|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_445.wav|247|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_359.wav|247|He said something in his work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_390.wav|247|Glasgow University declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_384.wav|247|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_451.wav|247|But you can go beyond that condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_271.wav|247|Did it work?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_047.wav|247|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_337.wav|247|We will listen to any suggestion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_101.wav|247|It was clear on Thursday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_470.wav|247|They were good years for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_193.wav|247|You know the sort of thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_066.wav|247|We could soon be in that same position!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_299.wav|247|The circumstances have changed since last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_250.wav|247|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_120.wav|247|There's still plenty time left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_316.wav|247|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_302.wav|247|I wanted to change the formula.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_134.wav|247|But it could be a consequence of our policy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_244.wav|247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_072.wav|247|You should try to have a laugh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_008.wav|247|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_378.wav|247|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_187.wav|247|I'm just going to hit the shot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_464.wav|247|I'm very passionate about my country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_268.wav|247|Messages have to be reinforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_097.wav|247|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_432.wav|247|It was a breathtaking moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_118.wav|247|The website has changed the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_354.wav|247|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_448.wav|247|There were no formal announcements.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_162.wav|247|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_212.wav|247|His injury was completely random.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_024.wav|247|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_030.wav|247|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_206.wav|247|The result is utterly compelling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_176.wav|247|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_389.wav|247|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_340.wav|247|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_426.wav|247|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_083.wav|247|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_227.wav|247|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_011.wav|247|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_361.wav|247|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_157.wav|247|I love the spectacle of cinema.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_407.wav|247|There was an element of frustration.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_294.wav|247|It was never a free kick.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_249.wav|247|Others agreed with this view.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_280.wav|247|Scotland won by six wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_139.wav|247|But it is different in different regions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_413.wav|247|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_143.wav|247|I have accepted the challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_469.wav|247|Now that business is banned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_375.wav|247|They have broken that promise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_005.wav|247|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_233.wav|247|It will be strictly cross-country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_126.wav|247|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_310.wav|247|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_060.wav|247|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_256.wav|247|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_476.wav|247|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_195.wav|247|It shows the strength of the roots.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_181.wav|247|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_462.wav|247|Then came the farewell to Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_148.wav|247|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_238.wav|247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_242.wav|247|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_074.wav|247|It wasn't possible to relax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_304.wav|247|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_418.wav|247|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_132.wav|247|Which can happen any time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_169.wav|247|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_443.wav|247|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_396.wav|247|It seems a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_219.wav|247|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_055.wav|247|We have to keep our clients.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_263.wav|247|He has also cut a record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_113.wav|247|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_439.wav|247|An alternative must be offered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_325.wav|247|His only reply was a laugh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_331.wav|247|This is a moment to seize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_107.wav|247|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_277.wav|247|He is quite well organised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_041.wav|247|The boy is no longer with us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_088.wav|247|Those people must be accountable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_382.wav|247|There is no deal as yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_457.wav|247|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_292.wav|247|It was exactly four months away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_401.wav|247|It proved a good decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_367.wav|247|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_151.wav|247|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_198.wav|247|It caused a lot of upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_221.wav|247|We used to live with dignity in our country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_017.wav|247|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_003.wav|247|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_235.wav|247|Truth is the child of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_145.wav|247|You are a gambling man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_373.wav|247|Neither woman has been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_415.wav|247|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_309.wav|247|The rescue package is public money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_079.wav|247|Both men were on one-year contracts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_286.wav|247|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_214.wav|247|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_022.wav|247|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_352.wav|247|There was some merit in that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_164.wav|247|That view has not altered.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_328.wav|247|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_434.wav|247|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_091.wav|247|We have to offer value for money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_058.wav|247|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_085.wav|247|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_420.wav|247|That is not the position of the British relatives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_170.wav|247|Nothing was meant by it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_346.wav|247|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_036.wav|247|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_200.wav|247|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_385.wav|247|to have products for their needs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_450.wav|247|It certainly appeared that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_336.wav|247|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_100.wav|247|And they had a case.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_270.wav|247|Does that put pressure on us?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_046.wav|247|It's not a swimming pool out there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_052.wav|247|The couple actually came upon the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_264.wav|247|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_114.wav|247|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_322.wav|247|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_444.wav|247|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_358.wav|247|The pain is still acute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_391.wav|247|He will consult the right people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_028.wav|247|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_245.wav|247|Those overseas offices were great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_073.wav|247|Robin Williams is very subdued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_303.wav|247|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_135.wav|247|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_379.wav|247|The group is not paying a dividend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_186.wav|247|It is vital to clarify their role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_465.wav|247|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_009.wav|247|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_471.wav|247|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_192.wav|247|I will have to order its destruction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_121.wav|247|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_317.wav|247|He was obviously very genuine.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_067.wav|247|It came as a surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_298.wav|247|They were worth the money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_251.wav|247|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_177.wav|247|That must be left to the Parole Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_388.wav|247|It benefits the whole family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_341.wav|247|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_031.wav|247|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_207.wav|247|It gave no further details.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_082.wav|247|It happens on an annual basis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_427.wav|247|My aim is a top six finish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_433.wav|247|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_119.wav|247|This is a step backwards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_269.wav|247|I didn't see the point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_096.wav|247|The woman is basically off her head.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_213.wav|247|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_025.wav|247|They are very clever in their use of words.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_355.wav|247|But the New Year was special.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_449.wav|247|He deserves a second chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_163.wav|247|He's not a Celtic man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_138.wav|247|We did what we had to do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_412.wav|247|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_248.wav|247|Three weeks later, he resigned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_281.wav|247|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_004.wav|247|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_232.wav|247|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_142.wav|247|I learned that only yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_468.wav|247|That should get their attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_374.wav|247|I got a yellow card.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_360.wav|247|It's wonderful to have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_156.wav|247|Before it was an ordeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_226.wav|247|The process will start tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_010.wav|247|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_295.wav|247|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_406.wav|247|But the foundations have been laid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_239.wav|247|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_180.wav|247|They could not match it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_463.wav|247|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_149.wav|247|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_305.wav|247|Tony Blair said as little.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_419.wav|247|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_133.wav|247|The answer was in space.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_243.wav|247|They have to be able to play the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_075.wav|247|I was very pleased with them today, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_061.wav|247|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_257.wav|247|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_127.wav|247|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_311.wav|247|The effect was almost magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_477.wav|247|The casting of her husband was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_194.wav|247|They were seriously after him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_276.wav|247|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_040.wav|247|It is serious - but not that serious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_089.wav|247|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_330.wav|247|The party lasted all night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_106.wav|247|Our preference is to play in midweek.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_383.wav|247|It's as wide as a church in here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_456.wav|247|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_218.wav|247|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_168.wav|247|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_442.wav|247|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_397.wav|247|They have not done so this season so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_112.wav|247|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_438.wav|247|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_324.wav|247|I was brought up in a mining background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_054.wav|247|Italy is a beautiful place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_262.wav|247|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_144.wav|247|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_372.wav|247|He had no previous convictions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_002.wav|247|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_234.wav|247|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_078.wav|247|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_287.wav|247|There's not much money in cycling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_414.wav|247|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_308.wav|247|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_400.wav|247|That investment has now been secured.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_293.wav|247|I understand the security issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_220.wav|247|Did he trip?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_016.wav|247|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_366.wav|247|He can handle it without any problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_150.wav|247|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_199.wav|247|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_421.wav|247|He seems to be used to the attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_084.wav|247|The party is up for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_037.wav|247|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_171.wav|247|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_347.wav|247|So what happens next?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_353.wav|247|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_165.wav|247|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_215.wav|247|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_023.wav|247|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_090.wav|247|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_059.wav|247|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_329.wav|247|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p247/p247_435.wav|247|It's going to be epic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_233.wav|248|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_005.wav|248|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_375.wav|248|The casualties were not named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_143.wav|248|It's a crucial award.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_139.wav|248|It was typical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_280.wav|248|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_249.wav|248|It was a cry for help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_294.wav|248|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_157.wav|248|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_361.wav|248|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_011.wav|248|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_227.wav|248|The track is currently covered in snow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_083.wav|248|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_340.wav|248|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_176.wav|248|IT S the real thing, for sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_206.wav|248|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_030.wav|248|I have a theory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_024.wav|248|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_212.wav|248|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_162.wav|248|It has to be now.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_354.wav|248|It was that bad, that low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_118.wav|248|But the fans deserve to know!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_097.wav|248|I had a ball today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_268.wav|248|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_187.wav|248|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_008.wav|248|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_072.wav|248|Then followed a bout of flu.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_244.wav|248|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_134.wav|248|Our intentions are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_302.wav|248|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_316.wav|248|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_120.wav|248|They've got to account for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_250.wav|248|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_299.wav|248|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_066.wav|248|There will be tough opponents to this report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_193.wav|248|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_101.wav|248|That time is not now, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_337.wav|248|Like his acting, it was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_047.wav|248|It is urgent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_271.wav|248|He was also married with two children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_359.wav|248|He later became a respected High Court judge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_029.wav|248|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_265.wav|248|This is a question of Islam.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_053.wav|248|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_323.wav|248|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_115.wav|248|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_200.wav|248|The service from the other players was super.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_036.wav|248|It's a matter of balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_346.wav|248|Tyson is overwhelmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_170.wav|248|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_085.wav|248|By then, he was walking on water.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_058.wav|248|It's very odd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_091.wav|248|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_328.wav|248|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_164.wav|248|I was in the train station overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_352.wav|248|He has seen the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_022.wav|248|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_214.wav|248|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_286.wav|248|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_079.wav|248|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_309.wav|248|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_373.wav|248|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_145.wav|248|There is a lack of chemistry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_235.wav|248|I haven't made the donation yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_003.wav|248|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_017.wav|248|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_221.wav|248|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_198.wav|248|It was still there, but right at the end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_151.wav|248|It is huge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_367.wav|248|Well, the big day has arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_292.wav|248|I thought it was my only chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_088.wav|248|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_041.wav|248|She is believed to be in South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_277.wav|248|He looked very sharp.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_107.wav|248|He pleaded for caution.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_331.wav|248|There's no place to hide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_325.wav|248|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_113.wav|248|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_263.wav|248|He will emerge as a world leader.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_055.wav|248|Here's a clue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_219.wav|248|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_169.wav|248|The post will be unpaid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_132.wav|248|It's the big omission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_304.wav|248|We have waited a long time for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_074.wav|248|I had my suspicions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_242.wav|248|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_238.wav|248|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_148.wav|248|It is like a football team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_181.wav|248|The goals were good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_195.wav|248|It wasn't to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_256.wav|248|they fail to engage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_060.wav|248|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_310.wav|248|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_126.wav|248|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_295.wav|248|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_010.wav|248|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_226.wav|248|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_156.wav|248|That includes the equipment?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_360.wav|248|He could face a jail sentence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_374.wav|248|He's a lovely young man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_142.wav|248|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_232.wav|248|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_004.wav|248|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_281.wav|248|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_248.wav|248|It's a record label, not a form of music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_138.wav|248|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_163.wav|248|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_355.wav|248|That would help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_025.wav|248|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_213.wav|248|Twaddle is a case in point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_096.wav|248|It is a delight on every level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_269.wav|248|Immediate action must be taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_119.wav|248|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_082.wav|248|Nothing is yet confirmed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_207.wav|248|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_031.wav|248|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_341.wav|248|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_177.wav|248|And I saw the light!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_251.wav|248|This year I understood.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_298.wav|248|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_067.wav|248|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_317.wav|248|He was unable to come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_121.wav|248|She's got to say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_192.wav|248|All options are open.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_009.wav|248|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_186.wav|248|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_135.wav|248|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_303.wav|248|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_073.wav|248|Neither it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_245.wav|248|It is hard won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_028.wav|248|That's no bad thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_358.wav|248|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_322.wav|248|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_114.wav|248|It's not a new concept in jazz.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_264.wav|248|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_052.wav|248|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_046.wav|248|No meaningful response was issued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_270.wav|248|He is a young man with a new deal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_100.wav|248|That would be unlawful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_336.wav|248|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_329.wav|248|He has to learn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_059.wav|248|It will take time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_090.wav|248|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_023.wav|248|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_215.wav|248|In each case they were a goal down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_165.wav|248|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_353.wav|248|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_347.wav|248|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_171.wav|248|Waiting times for these services are too long.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_201.wav|248|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_037.wav|248|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_084.wav|248|We have other options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_199.wav|248|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_150.wav|248|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_366.wav|248|It is legally binding.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_016.wav|248|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_220.wav|248|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_293.wav|248|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_308.wav|248|Craig is a major concern for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_287.wav|248|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_078.wav|248|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_234.wav|248|They should come forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_002.wav|248|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_372.wav|248|Colour was at the core of his life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_144.wav|248|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_262.wav|248|That is highly unfair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_054.wav|248|They had to explain it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_324.wav|248|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_112.wav|248|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_168.wav|248|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_218.wav|248|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_106.wav|248|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_330.wav|248|Indeed, it was magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_089.wav|248|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_040.wav|248|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_276.wav|248|If not, he should go home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_194.wav|248|However, this idea is never developed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_311.wav|248|Other people had looked at it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_127.wav|248|So the European elections are extremely important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_257.wav|248|They are real.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_061.wav|248|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_075.wav|248|He got the same story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_243.wav|248|She is well balanced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_133.wav|248|It plans to return to this field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_305.wav|248|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_149.wav|248|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_180.wav|248|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_239.wav|248|It is no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_048.wav|248|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_081.wav|248|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_338.wav|248|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_342.wav|248|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_174.wav|248|The jury is still out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_204.wav|248|Today was first class.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_032.wav|248|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_026.wav|248|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_210.wav|248|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_160.wav|248|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_356.wav|248|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_095.wav|248|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_231.wav|248|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_007.wav|248|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_188.wav|248|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_141.wav|248|He has the edge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_282.wav|248|It was a virus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_069.wav|248|Have a look at our accounts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_296.wav|248|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_319.wav|248|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_155.wav|248|They were later discharged from hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_363.wav|248|They have not done so this season so far.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_013.wav|248|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_225.wav|248|I have spoken to the skipper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_103.wav|248|I didn't play well last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_335.wav|248|The composer will conduct.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_045.wav|248|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_273.wav|248|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_209.wav|248|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_179.wav|248|Tony had arrived.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_267.wav|248|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_098.wav|248|Two of the team became ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_051.wav|248|But it might have done.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_321.wav|248|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_117.wav|248|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_185.wav|248|We did everything by the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_070.wav|248|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_246.wav|248|The scene is about this?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_136.wav|248|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_300.wav|248|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_314.wav|248|The parents will have a great time, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_122.wav|248|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_252.wav|248|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_064.wav|248|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_228.wav|248|But he failed to win the committee's support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_158.wav|248|That's the name of the game, though.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_191.wav|248|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_284.wav|248|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_371.wav|248|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_147.wav|248|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_237.wav|248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_001.wav|248|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_015.wav|248|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_223.wav|248|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_153.wav|248|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_365.wav|248|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_129.wav|248|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_290.wav|248|IT S all in the hair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_259.wav|248|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_202.wav|248|But she might be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_034.wav|248|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_344.wav|248|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_172.wav|248|They thought they had found a home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_108.wav|248|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_278.wav|248|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_087.wav|248|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_093.wav|248|He was possessed
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_166.wav|248|It's that sort of night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_350.wav|248|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_020.wav|248|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_216.wav|248|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_130.wav|248|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_306.wav|248|It's about my time as a guitarist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_076.wav|248|It works for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_240.wav|248|My future is in the marathon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_289.wav|248|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_183.wav|248|Four policemen were wounded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_368.wav|248|Five members were disciplined.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_197.wav|248|It's the same old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_018.wav|248|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_254.wav|248|We run within the law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_062.wav|248|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_312.wav|248|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_124.wav|248|I can't even get into the A team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_349.wav|248|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_039.wav|248|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_043.wav|248|It was ugly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_275.wav|248|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_105.wav|248|That all hope is never lost.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_333.wav|248|I said that I had been raped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_327.wav|248|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_111.wav|248|We do not expect any surplus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_261.wav|248|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_057.wav|248|Next league matches Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_161.wav|248|Eight months later, he was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_357.wav|248|Who was the mystery MP?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_027.wav|248|But it failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_211.wav|248|He is slightly confused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_094.wav|248|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_339.wav|248|It's the last thing on my mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_049.wav|248|The record companies have gone through the floor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_080.wav|248|It may well have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_205.wav|248|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_033.wav|248|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_343.wav|248|It is horrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_175.wav|248|Blair's response was weak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_318.wav|248|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_068.wav|248|It's good news and long overdue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_297.wav|248|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_012.wav|248|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_224.wav|248|It was good fun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_154.wav|248|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_362.wav|248|Now, though, he has an incentive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_376.wav|248|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_189.wav|248|You know the sort of thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_140.wav|248|I was the last man to touch the ball.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_230.wav|248|It's the same as Glasgow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_006.wav|248|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_283.wav|248|Maloney is an engaging talent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_320.wav|248|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_116.wav|248|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_266.wav|248|Of course, that is not the whole story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_099.wav|248|That's all right then.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_050.wav|248|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_044.wav|248|That is a break with tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_272.wav|248|He's been here on numerous occasions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_102.wav|248|Oil embargo endorsed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_334.wav|248|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_178.wav|248|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_208.wav|248|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_253.wav|248|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_065.wav|248|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_315.wav|248|Donald was his friend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_123.wav|248|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_159.wav|248|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_190.wav|248|I cannot say too much about them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_229.wav|248|At the time, he was a living legend.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_184.wav|248|They receive a high profile in the media.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_137.wav|248|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_301.wav|248|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_071.wav|248|There was an e-mail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_247.wav|248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_152.wav|248|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_364.wav|248|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_014.wav|248|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_222.wav|248|A career as a doctor is on hold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_291.wav|248|What has altered?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_258.wav|248|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_128.wav|248|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_285.wav|248|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_236.wav|248|It's very safe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_370.wav|248|I am a wealthy person.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_146.wav|248|This film will be totally awesome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_092.wav|248|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_021.wav|248|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_217.wav|248|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_167.wav|248|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_351.wav|248|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_345.wav|248|I kept going for her.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_173.wav|248|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_203.wav|248|It's just awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_035.wav|248|I expected these kind of questions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_279.wav|248|You've got to have both sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_086.wav|248|It's never too late.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_109.wav|248|I thought it was a fantastic game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_019.wav|248|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_369.wav|248|There is no signature.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_196.wav|248|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_313.wav|248|Off with their heads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_125.wav|248|She does not want to speak.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_255.wav|248|Kirkwood was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_063.wav|248|It is not great art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_077.wav|248|It is a time bomb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_241.wav|248|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_288.wav|248|The release attracted little attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_131.wav|248|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_307.wav|248|It should be equal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_182.wav|248|I've been there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_260.wav|248|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_056.wav|248|But the law is very clear on this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_326.wav|248|This is the way things should be handled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_110.wav|248|It had been played at festivals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_038.wav|248|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_348.wav|248|But nothing happened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_104.wav|248|That is no use.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_332.wav|248|It will be very, very tight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_042.wav|248|I was scared.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p248/p248_274.wav|248|I feel pretty good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_109.wav|249|It is a good day for the coalition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_279.wav|249|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_086.wav|249|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_203.wav|249|I wanted to put myself on the line.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_035.wav|249|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_345.wav|249|Eight months later, he was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_173.wav|249|It is not too late to get on board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_167.wav|249|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_351.wav|249|It was very formal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_021.wav|249|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_217.wav|249|This is a good move for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_092.wav|249|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_146.wav|249|Is that Titanic?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_236.wav|249|Broke the birdie record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_285.wav|249|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_128.wav|249|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_291.wav|249|These figures are truly awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_258.wav|249|They must play for each other.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_014.wav|249|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_222.wav|249|Twaddle is a case in point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_152.wav|249|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_042.wav|249|It's a crucial award.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_274.wav|249|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_104.wav|249|Then came the crunch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_332.wav|249|Who will do it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_348.wav|249|He had played well in that central role.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_038.wav|249|He did not know his daughter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_326.wav|249|It could have gone either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_110.wav|249|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_260.wav|249|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_056.wav|249|It's very odd.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_182.wav|249|The jury is still out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_131.wav|249|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_307.wav|249|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_077.wav|249|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_241.wav|249|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_288.wav|249|Scotland were beaten again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_255.wav|249|It is very important that we get the balance right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_063.wav|249|I'm just enjoying every match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_313.wav|249|Is there on his hands?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_125.wav|249|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_196.wav|249|I had a train to catch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_019.wav|249|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_283.wav|249|You've got to have both sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_230.wav|249|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_006.wav|249|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_189.wav|249|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_140.wav|249|I was the last man to touch the ball.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_154.wav|249|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_012.wav|249|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_224.wav|249|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_068.wav|249|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_297.wav|249|What has altered?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_318.wav|249|The problems began a long time ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_343.wav|249|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_205.wav|249|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_033.wav|249|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_049.wav|249|I would love to have him home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_080.wav|249|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_339.wav|249|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_094.wav|249|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_027.wav|249|It's nice to hear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_211.wav|249|Ferguson should take note.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_161.wav|249|There's a pause.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_071.wav|249|It is like a river running by my home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_247.wav|249|There wasn't a goal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_137.wav|249|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_301.wav|249|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_184.wav|249|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_229.wav|249|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_159.wav|249|It was by the numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_190.wav|249|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_315.wav|249|They were fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_123.wav|249|They've got to account for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_253.wav|249|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_065.wav|249|You did not change overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_208.wav|249|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_178.wav|249|The release attracted little attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_102.wav|249|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_044.wav|249|It's a blessing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_272.wav|249|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_266.wav|249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_099.wav|249|However, it did not end that way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_050.wav|249|He looks like an Afghan.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_320.wav|249|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_116.wav|249|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_020.wav|249|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_216.wav|249|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_166.wav|249|It is an attitude of mind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_350.wav|249|It is horrible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_093.wav|249|And rugby fans can help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_278.wav|249|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_087.wav|249|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_108.wav|249|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_344.wav|249|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_172.wav|249|Tell it like it was?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_202.wav|249|It is a case of taking a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_034.wav|249|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_290.wav|249|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_259.wav|249|His contract was then not renewed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_129.wav|249|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_153.wav|249|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_223.wav|249|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_237.wav|249|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_147.wav|249|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_284.wav|249|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_261.wav|249|That's the only thing I will say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_057.wav|249|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_327.wav|249|He was then replaced by Ross.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_111.wav|249|We want to get to the final, anyway.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_105.wav|249|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_043.wav|249|The boy is no longer with us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_275.wav|249|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_039.wav|249|She is believed to be in South Africa.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_349.wav|249|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_312.wav|249|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_124.wav|249|Who would have?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_254.wav|249|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_062.wav|249|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_018.wav|249|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_197.wav|249|It is tough, but possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_183.wav|249|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_076.wav|249|The play is based on a real-life event.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_240.wav|249|It's a lovely, lovely film.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_289.wav|249|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_130.wav|249|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_306.wav|249|They were on holiday in Egypt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_013.wav|249|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_225.wav|249|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_155.wav|249|The weaknesses are few.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_319.wav|249|Referees are easy targets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_069.wav|249|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_296.wav|249|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_282.wav|249|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_188.wav|249|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_141.wav|249|It's a question of fashion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_231.wav|249|It is a gamble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_007.wav|249|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_095.wav|249|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_160.wav|249|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_026.wav|249|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_210.wav|249|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_204.wav|249|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_032.wav|249|He took me on a tour of the wards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_342.wav|249|He's a genius.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_174.wav|249|We have a budget in March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_338.wav|249|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_048.wav|249|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_081.wav|249|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_191.wav|249|It is not fair.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_252.wav|249|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_064.wav|249|And a film maker was born.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_314.wav|249|Special measures were needed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_122.wav|249|Does this mean.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_136.wav|249|What will happen then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_300.wav|249|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_070.wav|249|Have a look at our accounts.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_246.wav|249|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_185.wav|249|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_321.wav|249|I came into this world with nothing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_117.wav|249|It's a long process.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_267.wav|249|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_098.wav|249|Today I couldn't run on it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_051.wav|249|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_179.wav|249|Someone who cares
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_209.wav|249|I have a cold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_045.wav|249|Is a drug dealer?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_273.wav|249|Things can change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_103.wav|249|Until you hit the big games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_335.wav|249|I must make that clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_144.wav|249|He is severe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_234.wav|249|He is in the queue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_002.wav|249|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_287.wav|249|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_078.wav|249|He highlighted a lack of staff.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_308.wav|249|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_293.wav|249|Sunday's game was not a trial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_016.wav|249|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_220.wav|249|Feel the heat?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_199.wav|249|However, this idea is never developed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_150.wav|249|It is like a football team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_084.wav|249|I've not thought about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_201.wav|249|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_037.wav|249|It is not for any other purpose.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_347.wav|249|It's all going to clear the debt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_171.wav|249|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_165.wav|249|These days are long gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_353.wav|249|I kept going for her.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_023.wav|249|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_059.wav|249|It will take time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_090.wav|249|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_329.wav|249|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_239.wav|249|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_149.wav|249|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_180.wav|249|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_133.wav|249|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_305.wav|249|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_075.wav|249|Painful, but only because it's true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_243.wav|249|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_257.wav|249|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_061.wav|249|Jobs could go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_311.wav|249|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_127.wav|249|There were no grounds for his action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_194.wav|249|I put the drawing down.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_089.wav|249|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_040.wav|249|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_276.wav|249|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_106.wav|249|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_330.wav|249|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_218.wav|249|But I am a worried man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_168.wav|249|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_324.wav|249|I am so upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_112.wav|249|It is a good lifestyle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_262.wav|249|Blood samples were taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_054.wav|249|Next league matches Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_341.wav|249|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_177.wav|249|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_207.wav|249|The service from the other players was super.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_031.wav|249|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_082.wav|249|It is a job creation scheme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_119.wav|249|It was ugly.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_096.wav|249|Now the system is right behind us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_269.wav|249|And Michael was just great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_025.wav|249|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_213.wav|249|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_163.wav|249|They should stop the bombing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_138.wav|249|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_281.wav|249|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_248.wav|249|I was shocked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_232.wav|249|My neighbours are horrified.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_004.wav|249|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_142.wav|249|We need to chat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_156.wav|249|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_010.wav|249|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_226.wav|249|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_295.wav|249|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_100.wav|249|We must look forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_336.wav|249|The train was on time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_046.wav|249|As she explains.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_270.wav|249|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_052.wav|249|It will come all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_322.wav|249|That's the law of the land.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_114.wav|249|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_028.wav|249|They should be so lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_073.wav|249|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_245.wav|249|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_135.wav|249|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_303.wav|249|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_186.wav|249|It should be easy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_009.wav|249|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_192.wav|249|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_317.wav|249|They wanted the club to make money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_121.wav|249|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_251.wav|249|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_298.wav|249|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_067.wav|249|Scotland had great assets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_292.wav|249|He should have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_198.wav|249|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_017.wav|249|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_221.wav|249|We'll have to work hard today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_235.wav|249|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_003.wav|249|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_145.wav|249|It is difficult for Ali.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_309.wav|249|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_286.wav|249|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_079.wav|249|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_022.wav|249|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_214.wav|249|It's all about money, money, money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_164.wav|249|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_352.wav|249|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_328.wav|249|My view has now completely changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_058.wav|249|It is unique.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_170.wav|249|I'm so worried about the roads.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_200.wav|249|Last night was a key episode.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_036.wav|249|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_310.wav|249|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_126.wav|249|You can spend money on housing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_256.wav|249|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_060.wav|249|That's the truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_148.wav|249|The idea is simple.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_181.wav|249|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_238.wav|249|We were a load of rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_074.wav|249|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_132.wav|249|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_304.wav|249|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_169.wav|249|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_219.wav|249|There was an e-mail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_263.wav|249|They are never here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_055.wav|249|It happens from time to time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_113.wav|249|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_107.wav|249|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_331.wav|249|The same things will happen with GM foods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_088.wav|249|She had kept the news from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_041.wav|249|Sure, it's funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_277.wav|249|He has a wealth of experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_097.wav|249|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_268.wav|249|It is the same in Sweden.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_118.wav|249|They were behind the wheel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_162.wav|249|Neither side can win this war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_354.wav|249|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_024.wav|249|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_212.wav|249|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_206.wav|249|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_030.wav|249|There's a story, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_340.wav|249|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_176.wav|249|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_083.wav|249|Even the one she loved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_011.wav|249|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_157.wav|249|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_294.wav|249|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_280.wav|249|There's nothing I can say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_249.wav|249|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_139.wav|249|It was very frightened and dirty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_143.wav|249|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_005.wav|249|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_323.wav|249|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_115.wav|249|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_265.wav|249|He has not created a Festival resource.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_053.wav|249|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_029.wav|249|Because we do not need it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_047.wav|249|He is too weak to move.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_271.wav|249|It's not even finished.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_101.wav|249|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_337.wav|249|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_193.wav|249|We want to help them through it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_299.wav|249|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_066.wav|249|There was a battle there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_316.wav|249|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_120.wav|249|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_134.wav|249|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_302.wav|249|They are wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_072.wav|249|Try to save us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_244.wav|249|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_008.wav|249|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p249/p249_187.wav|249|Everyone can be bought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_408.wav|250|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_314.wav|250|The circumstances have changed since last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_064.wav|250|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_252.wav|250|The most important thing is the game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_228.wav|250|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_472.wav|250|He certainly did a good job!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_191.wav|250|Our fans have been marvellous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_158.wav|250|What do we want to do that for?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_185.wav|250|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_466.wav|250|The boys are mentally focused.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_246.wav|250|His background is firmly in venture capital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_070.wav|250|I am about protecting the state pension.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_300.wav|250|I understand the security issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_136.wav|250|Failure is not an option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_447.wav|250|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_392.wav|250|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_051.wav|250|Strikers like to go to the ground.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_098.wav|250|So, did she meet him?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_267.wav|250|We've had several problems over injuries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_117.wav|250|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_321.wav|250|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_335.wav|250|It was nice to finish in style.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_103.wav|250|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_429.wav|250|That was the agreement with the manager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_273.wav|250|There will be widespread support on all sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_045.wav|250|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_209.wav|250|It was a moment of madness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_386.wav|250|Is it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_179.wav|250|You will be very welcome.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_453.wav|250|But you can go beyond that condition.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_296.wav|250|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_069.wav|250|Only water is currently allowed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_319.wav|250|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_405.wav|250|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_363.wav|250|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_155.wav|250|Are you going to win?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_225.wav|250|I think, therefore I am?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_013.wav|250|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_007.wav|250|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_231.wav|250|His third goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_141.wav|250|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_188.wav|250|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_377.wav|250|Those people must be accountable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_411.wav|250|We're not taking any risks.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_282.wav|250|We are aiming for early March.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_210.wav|250|And we have the experience.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_026.wav|250|Meetings will also remain private.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_356.wav|250|I'd like to take the plunge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_160.wav|250|He was pleased with his display.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_483.wav|250|That argument has been won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_430.wav|250|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_095.wav|250|It is high time to act.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_081.wav|250|It makes for an interesting conference.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_048.wav|250|Do I have a favourite?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_424.wav|250|The next few months will tell.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_338.wav|250|And he goes with it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_174.wav|250|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_342.wav|250|The letters are going out today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_032.wav|250|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_204.wav|250|We are going through difficult times.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_111.wav|250|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_327.wav|250|I was brought up in a mining background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_057.wav|250|I expect a rapid response.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_261.wav|250|He was good, but not that good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_488.wav|250|The Israeli military denied the claim.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_441.wav|250|There were a lot of emotions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_394.wav|250|I always knew she was funny.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_349.wav|250|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_380.wav|250|There is no deal as yet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_455.wav|250|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_039.wav|250|Costs have got to be controlled.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_275.wav|250|I got a yellow card.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_043.wav|250|This represents a tough game for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_333.wav|250|The party lasted all night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_105.wav|250|He was released after treatment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_474.wav|250|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_197.wav|250|Aberdeen had little to offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_368.wav|250|We put our bid in last night.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_018.wav|250|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_062.wav|250|We have to keep our clients.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_254.wav|250|Paterson can afford to be generous.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_124.wav|250|Before the game we went for a pint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_312.wav|250|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_306.wav|250|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_130.wav|250|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_289.wav|250|It is also very valuable.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_240.wav|250|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_076.wav|250|I was as strong as a horse.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_183.wav|250|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_460.wav|250|It was like someone had died.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_093.wav|250|The excitement could hardly be contained.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_436.wav|250|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_399.wav|250|The law would appear to be on our side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_350.wav|250|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_166.wav|250|The whole industry is a shambles.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_485.wav|250|And rugby fans can help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_216.wav|250|It was worth a photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_020.wav|250|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_034.wav|250|Smoking is also very important.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_202.wav|250|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_458.wav|250|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_491.wav|250|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_172.wav|250|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_344.wav|250|We will listen to any suggestion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_422.wav|250|The BBC was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_108.wav|250|We knew they could do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_087.wav|250|They lived for their children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_278.wav|250|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_223.wav|250|how do you get it back?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_015.wav|250|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_365.wav|250|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_153.wav|250|She died at her home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_479.wav|250|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_129.wav|250|I have learned from him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_403.wav|250|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_290.wav|250|I feel really confident in that department.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_284.wav|250|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_417.wav|250|It became a national network.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_147.wav|250|You are a gambling man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_371.wav|250|I was delighted to accept.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_001.wav|250|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_237.wav|250|The transaction is not feasible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_184.wav|250|They could not match it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_467.wav|250|This is the stuff of live music.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_301.wav|250|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_137.wav|250|She's got to say something.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_247.wav|250|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_071.wav|250|He later became a respected High Court judge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_065.wav|250|This is the first step.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_253.wav|250|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_409.wav|250|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_123.wav|250|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_315.wav|250|It's all designed to speed up the service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_473.wav|250|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_190.wav|250|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_159.wav|250|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_229.wav|250|It had all been arranged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_272.wav|250|I should think so, too.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_044.wav|250|I made a terrible start.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_334.wav|250|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_102.wav|250|Had I heard?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_428.wav|250|There is a solution, she believes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_387.wav|250|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_178.wav|250|I'd love to be like Peter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_452.wav|250|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_208.wav|250|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_446.wav|250|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_393.wav|250|One-third of the places are already taken.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_116.wav|250|He was prepared for this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_320.wav|250|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_050.wav|250|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_099.wav|250|So what is the campaign about?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_266.wav|250|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_140.wav|250|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_189.wav|250|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_376.wav|250|The salary changes are long overdue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_006.wav|250|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_230.wav|250|My daughter is an adult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_283.wav|250|I felt about this big.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_410.wav|250|Growth will come later in the cycle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_318.wav|250|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_404.wav|250|It has only been rumours.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_297.wav|250|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_068.wav|250|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_224.wav|250|What are you not good at?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_012.wav|250|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_362.wav|250|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_154.wav|250|What happened in that game?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_425.wav|250|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_339.wav|250|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_080.wav|250|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_049.wav|250|It comes from reflection or thinking.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_033.wav|250|He works at the airport.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_205.wav|250|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_496.wav|250|Subsidy income will not be affected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_175.wav|250|He was asked to quit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_343.wav|250|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_357.wav|250|Finally came the moment of truth.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_161.wav|250|Life is still very tough for them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_482.wav|250|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_211.wav|250|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_027.wav|250|I am pretty careful with money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_094.wav|250|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_431.wav|250|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_038.wav|250|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_348.wav|250|A Home Office spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_381.wav|250|It's as wide as a church in here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_454.wav|250|The removal would take place in France.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_332.wav|250|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_104.wav|250|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_274.wav|250|Messages have to be reinforced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_042.wav|250|No meaningful response was issued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_056.wav|250|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_260.wav|250|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_110.wav|250|They must be on commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_326.wav|250|McNaughton was not so sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_489.wav|250|He is not a dancer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_440.wav|250|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_395.wav|250|Everyone could see the joke.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_288.wav|250|Is it in the right place?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_241.wav|250|That you can do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_077.wav|250|He was a lovely man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_131.wav|250|He thought she was amazing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_182.wav|250|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_461.wav|250|The budget was too low for that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_019.wav|250|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_475.wav|250|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_196.wav|250|It was a bit like having children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_369.wav|250|He had no access to the database.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_125.wav|250|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_313.wav|250|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_063.wav|250|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_255.wav|250|The right decision has been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_459.wav|250|The jury is still out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_490.wav|250|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_173.wav|250|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_345.wav|250|The Premier League has been a huge success.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_035.wav|250|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_086.wav|250|He put some colour into Scottish history.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_423.wav|250|Russell is delighted with them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_109.wav|250|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_437.wav|250|The trial will open today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_092.wav|250|That view is held by many others within the industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_217.wav|250|The move follows a review of the Singapore
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_021.wav|250|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_398.wav|250|He has earned the right to their respect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_351.wav|250|It was tough to contain the excitement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_167.wav|250|People were actually not on his side.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_484.wav|250|It was a narrow escape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_416.wav|250|The breakdown was much later in her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_285.wav|250|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_236.wav|250|It's just a normal life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_146.wav|250|You've got to be vigilant.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_370.wav|250|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_364.wav|250|Three years ago he would have been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_152.wav|250|We will try to find someone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_478.wav|250|Well, he is an artist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_222.wav|250|Does the name matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_014.wav|250|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_258.wav|250|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_291.wav|250|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_128.wav|250|That's not an assumption that I had made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_402.wav|250|Theatre is not a museum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_445.wav|250|Everything in golf is a balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_359.wav|250|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_390.wav|250|After the match, do you?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_053.wav|250|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_265.wav|250|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_115.wav|250|It's good to have a voice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_323.wav|250|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_337.wav|250|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_101.wav|250|Are you from the rugby?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_271.wav|250|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_047.wav|250|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_384.wav|250|They will fight for everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_451.wav|250|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_120.wav|250|It didn't come as any great surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_316.wav|250|I wanted to change the formula.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_066.wav|250|We will pay their bills.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_299.wav|250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_250.wav|250|She will attend in July.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_193.wav|250|They need to look after themselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_378.wav|250|She said they would appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_187.wav|250|This championship is different from the other majors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_464.wav|250|The damage is all inside.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_008.wav|250|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_244.wav|250|During the communist time they were very privileged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_072.wav|250|Robin Williams is very subdued.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_302.wav|250|It was an easy decision to come here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_134.wav|250|It isn't a happy memory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_212.wav|250|It gave no further details.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_024.wav|250|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_354.wav|250|It's wonderful to have won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_448.wav|250|The people around me were fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_162.wav|250|It is not just about pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_481.wav|250|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_432.wav|250|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_118.wav|250|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_268.wav|250|That was a disgraceful performance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_097.wav|250|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_083.wav|250|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_426.wav|250|The second goal was superb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_495.wav|250|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_176.wav|250|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_389.wav|250|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_340.wav|250|There will be good prospects ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_030.wav|250|This is a central issue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_206.wav|250|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_294.wav|250|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_407.wav|250|My immune system had been depleted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_361.wav|250|Are they free?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_157.wav|250|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_227.wav|250|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_011.wav|250|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_005.wav|250|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_233.wav|250|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_143.wav|250|My life has changed a lot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_469.wav|250|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_375.wav|250|We are really good friends.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_139.wav|250|This is a frightening development.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_413.wav|250|I had a fortunate war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_249.wav|250|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_280.wav|250|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_476.wav|250|I have always believed in myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_195.wav|250|They were seriously after him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_060.wav|250|There's still plenty time left.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_126.wav|250|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_310.wav|250|You have to expect this type of thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_304.wav|250|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_418.wav|250|It is a large number.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_132.wav|250|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_242.wav|250|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_074.wav|250|We need to increase the membership.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_238.wav|250|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_181.wav|250|That would open the gates of hell.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_462.wav|250|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_148.wav|250|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_113.wav|250|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_439.wav|250|I never won a penny throughout my career.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_325.wav|250|There's still no-one like him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_055.wav|250|The teacher would have approved.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_263.wav|250|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_219.wav|250|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_169.wav|250|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_443.wav|250|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_396.wav|250|The marshall at the turn was great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_382.wav|250|She is obviously very disappointed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_457.wav|250|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_277.wav|250|We accept the new rules.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_088.wav|250|Potions said he would drive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_331.wav|250|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_107.wav|250|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_221.wav|250|That might help a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_017.wav|250|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_367.wav|250|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_151.wav|250|I love the spectacle of cinema.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_198.wav|250|We represent a wide range of society.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_401.wav|250|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_292.wav|250|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_079.wav|250|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_286.wav|250|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_415.wav|250|It's too close to call.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_309.wav|250|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_003.wav|250|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_235.wav|250|The process will start tomorrow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_091.wav|250|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_058.wav|250|She said she was really sorry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_328.wav|250|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_434.wav|250|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_352.wav|250|The pain is still acute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_164.wav|250|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_487.wav|250|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_214.wav|250|I won't make an official complaint.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_022.wav|250|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_036.wav|250|It was just appalling luck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_200.wav|250|We always felt we could win.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_493.wav|250|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_170.wav|250|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_346.wav|250|He has made his base in Spain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_420.wav|250|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_085.wav|250|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_270.wav|250|It was a kind of contempt.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_046.wav|250|How are you, sir?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_336.wav|250|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_100.wav|250|And does it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_385.wav|250|We will win the argument.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_450.wav|250|And we might go back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_028.wav|250|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_444.wav|250|We know about the crisis in cattle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_358.wav|250|We have very limited capacity.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_391.wav|250|The team hadn't been picked.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_114.wav|250|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_322.wav|250|The effect was almost magical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_052.wav|250|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_264.wav|250|He is a reporter for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_009.wav|250|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_379.wav|250|The countryside is in crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_186.wav|250|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_465.wav|250|Let that be their memorial.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_135.wav|250|We have a team to reach the final.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_245.wav|250|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_073.wav|250|It wasn't possible to relax.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_067.wav|250|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_298.wav|250|He has not created a Festival resource.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_251.wav|250|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_121.wav|250|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_317.wav|250|He will address the nation this evening.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_471.wav|250|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_192.wav|250|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_427.wav|250|I am astonished at attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_082.wav|250|I've had it for the exams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_031.wav|250|We will not tolerate it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_207.wav|250|You could feel the heat.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_494.wav|250|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_177.wav|250|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_388.wav|250|How do you take them away?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_341.wav|250|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_355.wav|250|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_449.wav|250|That will be best for him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_163.wav|250|It opens the door to the Champions League.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_480.wav|250|The casting of her husband was an accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_025.wav|250|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_269.wav|250|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_096.wav|250|Why do it otherwise?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_433.wav|250|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_119.wav|250|No, the equipment is extra.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_142.wav|250|That is far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_468.wav|250|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_374.wav|250|It's fantastic to win again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_004.wav|250|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_232.wav|250|It will affect their work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_248.wav|250|I have spoken to the skipper.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_281.wav|250|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_138.wav|250|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_412.wav|250|Neither man has been charged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_406.wav|250|Rugby is a hard game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_295.wav|250|We shall rely on human beings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_226.wav|250|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_010.wav|250|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_360.wav|250|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_156.wav|250|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_243.wav|250|A career as a doctor is on hold.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_075.wav|250|There's nothing they can get on me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_305.wav|250|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_419.wav|250|She started to put on weight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_133.wav|250|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_180.wav|250|It had so much to do with output.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_463.wav|250|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_149.wav|250|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_239.wav|250|It is good for our team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_477.wav|250|The chief constable has retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_194.wav|250|Miller was every bit as happy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_127.wav|250|I understand the medical concerns.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_311.wav|250|Stephen will get his first cap.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_061.wav|250|Let's hope that it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_257.wav|250|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_383.wav|250|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_456.wav|250|But we have built a platform for next season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_330.wav|250|Job losses were also announced.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_106.wav|250|We have made no final decisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_276.wav|250|This is no reflection on Rangers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_040.wav|250|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_089.wav|250|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_054.wav|250|I had trouble with the producers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_262.wav|250|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_438.wav|250|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_324.wav|250|Holland won by five wickets.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_168.wav|250|The defender made an impressive debut.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_442.wav|250|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_397.wav|250|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_218.wav|250|It carried a double message.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_414.wav|250|The choice is strictly personal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_308.wav|250|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_078.wav|250|Both sides have been hit by injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_287.wav|250|Do I think about them often?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_002.wav|250|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_234.wav|250|I am considered a teenager.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_144.wav|250|We did what we had to do.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_372.wav|250|They should take their mobile phones.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_366.wav|250|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_150.wav|250|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_199.wav|250|He was rejected because he had retired.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_220.wav|250|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_016.wav|250|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_293.wav|250|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_400.wav|250|There was a substantial explosion.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_492.wav|250|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_171.wav|250|They have not been named.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_037.wav|250|Rugby has an extended run.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_201.wav|250|It may have been a cry for help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_084.wav|250|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_421.wav|250|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_329.wav|250|The takeover comes as no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_435.wav|250|No date has been fixed for his return.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_090.wav|250|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_059.wav|250|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_215.wav|250|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_023.wav|250|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_353.wav|250|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_165.wav|250|It has become a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p250/p250_486.wav|250|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_218.wav|251|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_168.wav|251|The post will be unpaid.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_112.wav|251|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_324.wav|251|You are the glory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_054.wav|251|I had relied on him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_262.wav|251|He's a lovely young man.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_276.wav|251|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_040.wav|251|It was clear.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_089.wav|251|We must look forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_330.wav|251|It is out there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_106.wav|251|He was jailed for a year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_061.wav|251|They're appalled by that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_257.wav|251|Chambers said he would accept the place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_127.wav|251|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_311.wav|251|For the moment, our position remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_194.wav|251|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_239.wav|251|We were awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_180.wav|251|We knew nothing about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_149.wav|251|You know the type.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_305.wav|251|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_133.wav|251|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_243.wav|251|It is set in Paris.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_075.wav|251|Today she has been released.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_353.wav|251|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_165.wav|251|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_215.wav|251|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_023.wav|251|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_090.wav|251|It is an old family habit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_059.wav|251|It's a real challenge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_329.wav|251|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_084.wav|251|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_037.wav|251|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_201.wav|251|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_171.wav|251|I always felt they played for me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_347.wav|251|The team for the first game could be this one.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_293.wav|251|One knows the feeling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_220.wav|251|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_016.wav|251|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_366.wav|251|However, it was well worth the wait.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_150.wav|251|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_199.wav|251|It's the same old story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_144.wav|251|We have seen a copy of the report.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_372.wav|251|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_002.wav|251|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_234.wav|251|I am immensely sad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_078.wav|251|I was too young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_287.wav|251|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_308.wav|251|Scotland were beaten again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_192.wav|251|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_121.wav|251|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_317.wav|251|We have to sort it out ourselves.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_067.wav|251|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_298.wav|251|People have no choice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_251.wav|251|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_245.wav|251|It's quite a line-up!
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_073.wav|251|It is a time bomb.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_303.wav|251|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_135.wav|251|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_186.wav|251|I cannot say too much about them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_009.wav|251|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_052.wav|251|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_264.wav|251|We are ready.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_114.wav|251|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_322.wav|251|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_028.wav|251|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_336.wav|251|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_100.wav|251|No date has been set for the appeal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_270.wav|251|they fail to engage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_046.wav|251|That should do it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_360.wav|251|They got upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_156.wav|251|I saw one body.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_226.wav|251|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_010.wav|251|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_295.wav|251|It's a way of life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_138.wav|251|Is that it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_248.wav|251|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_281.wav|251|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_004.wav|251|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_232.wav|251|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_142.wav|251|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_374.wav|251|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_119.wav|251|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_269.wav|251|Kirkwood was arrested.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_096.wav|251|Journalists should make him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_213.wav|251|Now, it's all right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_025.wav|251|Johnson was pretty low.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_355.wav|251|I'm very lucky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_163.wav|251|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_177.wav|251|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_341.wav|251|It could have gone either way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_207.wav|251|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_082.wav|251|You will be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_331.wav|251|They had a confession.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_107.wav|251|It had been played at festivals.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_041.wav|251|They may be wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_088.wav|251|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_169.wav|251|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_219.wav|251|We have got to get it right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_055.wav|251|This is a step backwards.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_263.wav|251|It was a hit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_113.wav|251|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_325.wav|251|The letters are going out today.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_181.wav|251|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_148.wav|251|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_238.wav|251|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_242.wav|251|They had no children.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_074.wav|251|I've not thought about it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_304.wav|251|You've got to have both sides.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_132.wav|251|Government will intervene.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_126.wav|251|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_310.wav|251|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_060.wav|251|It is not great art.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_256.wav|251|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_195.wav|251|It is a case of taking a risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_085.wav|251|We have turned the corner.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_170.wav|251|They thought they had found a home.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_346.wav|251|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_036.wav|251|Was it worth it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_200.wav|251|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_214.wav|251|There was an e-mail.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_022.wav|251|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_352.wav|251|Well, it won't.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_164.wav|251|Tell it like it was?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_328.wav|251|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_091.wav|251|Until you hit the big games.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_058.wav|251|Four other charges were dropped.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_003.wav|251|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_235.wav|251|I'd never seen a play about me.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_145.wav|251|The songs are just so good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_373.wav|251|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_309.wav|251|Who did the recruiting?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_079.wav|251|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_286.wav|251|He has not created a Festival resource.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_292.wav|251|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_367.wav|251|He has seen the past.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_151.wav|251|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_198.wav|251|It was typical.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_221.wav|251|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_017.wav|251|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_302.wav|251|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_134.wav|251|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_244.wav|251|They should come forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_072.wav|251|It was chaotic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_008.wav|251|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_187.wav|251|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_193.wav|251|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_066.wav|251|He was popular.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_299.wav|251|She looked so young.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_250.wav|251|My future is in the marathon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_120.wav|251|We work on the same level.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_316.wav|251|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_271.wav|251|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_047.wav|251|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_337.wav|251|It's not long enough.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_101.wav|251|It is a good lifestyle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_115.wav|251|Maybe this battle has been.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_323.wav|251|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_053.wav|251|We were surprised to see the photograph.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_265.wav|251|They know no other way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_029.wav|251|However, the following year the cancer returned.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_359.wav|251|It is not like working for a living.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_249.wav|251|Of further privacy, he had no need.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_280.wav|251|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_139.wav|251|I had decided to quit the show.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_143.wav|251|We just had a go.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_005.wav|251|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_233.wav|251|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_227.wav|251|IT S the real thing, for sure.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_011.wav|251|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_361.wav|251|I saw some good things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_157.wav|251|There's a pause.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_294.wav|251|Things can change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_030.wav|251|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_206.wav|251|A deadline is still essential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_176.wav|251|It is not either national standards or local control.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_340.wav|251|The police have to act to help them.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_083.wav|251|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_268.wav|251|They are interior designers and architects.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_097.wav|251|They were outside the circle.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_118.wav|251|It is rubbish.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_162.wav|251|We have to move forward.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_212.wav|251|We have an election in eight days.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_024.wav|251|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_063.wav|251|It was all in a short period of time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_255.wav|251|It is hard won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_125.wav|251|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_313.wav|251|These figures are truly awful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_196.wav|251|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_369.wav|251|That would help.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_019.wav|251|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_182.wav|251|Four policemen were wounded.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_307.wav|251|This is a national crisis.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_131.wav|251|If not, a deal could take many months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_288.wav|251|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_241.wav|251|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_077.wav|251|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_110.wav|251|I was angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_326.wav|251|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_056.wav|251|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_260.wav|251|His body was never found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_274.wav|251|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_042.wav|251|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_332.wav|251|However, the groups denied the claims.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_104.wav|251|Further protests are likely.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_348.wav|251|The same things will happen with GM foods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_038.wav|251|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_128.wav|251|Well, you can have a tree.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_258.wav|251|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_291.wav|251|We're in shock.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_222.wav|251|Work has started.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_014.wav|251|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_364.wav|251|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_152.wav|251|He seemed to lose his focus.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_146.wav|251|It is like a football team.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_236.wav|251|It is a gamble.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_285.wav|251|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_351.wav|251|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_167.wav|251|You are not going in blind.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_217.wav|251|I began to pray.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_021.wav|251|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_092.wav|251|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_109.wav|251|You had better believe it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_279.wav|251|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_035.wav|251|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_203.wav|251|The conference is the first test.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_173.wav|251|One season, they might do well.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_345.wav|251|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_050.wav|251|It is the whole package.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_099.wav|251|That would be unlawful.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_266.wav|251|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_116.wav|251|I joined a group.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_320.wav|251|Our task is to complete the picture.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_208.wav|251|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_178.wav|251|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_334.wav|251|That's the law of the land.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_102.wav|251|That is no use.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_272.wav|251|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_044.wav|251|We will push.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_190.wav|251|However, this idea is never developed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_159.wav|251|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_123.wav|251|I'm so angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_315.wav|251|A new school will be built.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_065.wav|251|And if he hadn't become a musician?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_253.wav|251|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_247.wav|251|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_071.wav|251|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_301.wav|251|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_137.wav|251|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_184.wav|251|What has caused the demise of singing?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_094.wav|251|If you could find it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_211.wav|251|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_027.wav|251|That's no bad thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_357.wav|251|The composer will conduct.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_161.wav|251|Eight months later, he was dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_175.wav|251|We wanted it left for a wee while.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_343.wav|251|He can do no wrong.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_033.wav|251|Peace was won.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_205.wav|251|They've got three-quarters of the way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_080.wav|251|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_049.wav|251|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_339.wav|251|He was not a big name.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_362.wav|251|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_154.wav|251|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_224.wav|251|It's just a place to open it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_012.wav|251|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_297.wav|251|I am an estate agent.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_068.wav|251|That was the easy election.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_318.wav|251|He said she was mad.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_283.wav|251|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_006.wav|251|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_230.wav|251|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_140.wav|251|I am totally devoted to this job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_189.wav|251|People will ask about us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_183.wav|251|We did everything by the book.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_289.wav|251|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_240.wav|251|However, no further action was taken by police.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_076.wav|251|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_306.wav|251|Who will perform?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_130.wav|251|We had a reunion last week.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_124.wav|251|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_312.wav|251|The results are sometimes contentious.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_062.wav|251|It's that kind of place.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_254.wav|251|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_018.wav|251|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_197.wav|251|It wasn't to be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_368.wav|251|We will be homeless.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_333.wav|251|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_105.wav|251|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_275.wav|251|I am very angry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_043.wav|251|Dancing was her life.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_039.wav|251|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_349.wav|251|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_057.wav|251|What was the main difference?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_111.wav|251|The fire was above the hole.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_327.wav|251|We are a peaceful people.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_001.wav|251|Please call Stella.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_237.wav|251|But he failed to win the committee's support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_147.wav|251|That group reported just before Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_284.wav|251|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_259.wav|251|They tried to give her advice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_290.wav|251|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_129.wav|251|It was the same at Twickenham.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_365.wav|251|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_153.wav|251|It is not normal practice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_223.wav|251|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_015.wav|251|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_087.wav|251|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_278.wav|251|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_108.wav|251|I came to complete.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_172.wav|251|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_344.wav|251|Finally, he paid for the movie.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_034.wav|251|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_202.wav|251|There was no option.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_216.wav|251|Twaddle is a case in point.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_020.wav|251|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_350.wav|251|He did a good job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_166.wav|251|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_093.wav|251|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_179.wav|251|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_209.wav|251|Today was first class.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_273.wav|251|I was happily surprised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_045.wav|251|I feel pretty good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_335.wav|251|There was no time scale.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_103.wav|251|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_117.wav|251|Does this mean.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_321.wav|251|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_051.wav|251|He had no enemies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_098.wav|251|Two of the team became ill.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_267.wav|251|We run within the law.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_300.wav|251|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_136.wav|251|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_246.wav|251|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_070.wav|251|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_185.wav|251|We want to help them through it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_191.wav|251|Last night was a key episode.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_158.wav|251|Neither side can win this war.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_228.wav|251|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_064.wav|251|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_252.wav|251|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_122.wav|251|She has been shot.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_314.wav|251|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_032.wav|251|It's a matter of balance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_204.wav|251|I saw some terrible things.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_174.wav|251|The jury is still out.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_342.wav|251|Is that an issue?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_338.wav|251|I am so upset.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_081.wav|251|War is not the action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_048.wav|251|As she explains.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_095.wav|251|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_356.wav|251|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_160.wav|251|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_210.wav|251|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_026.wav|251|But it failed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_282.wav|251|That's the only thing I will say.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_141.wav|251|Three penalties were given.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_188.wav|251|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_007.wav|251|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_231.wav|251|We played them off the pitch.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_225.wav|251|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_013.wav|251|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_155.wav|251|I knew he was good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_319.wav|251|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_296.wav|251|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p251/p251_069.wav|251|There could be a way back.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_406.wav|252|Does it matter?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_295.wav|252|Kenny and I are ready.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_226.wav|252|I'd rather play well next week than here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_010.wav|252|People look, but no one ever finds it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_360.wav|252|They had better be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_156.wav|252|Who was she?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_142.wav|252|That shows the impact it had.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_374.wav|252|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_004.wav|252|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_232.wav|252|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_248.wav|252|We have several options.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_281.wav|252|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_138.wav|252|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_355.wav|252|What form did that take?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_163.wav|252|Mr Dewar understood that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_213.wav|252|Business will continue as usual.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_025.wav|252|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_269.wav|252|We still think this trade is on the increase.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_096.wav|252|Now comes the hard part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_119.wav|252|Its failure is no surprise.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_082.wav|252|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_207.wav|252|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_177.wav|252|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_388.wav|252|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_341.wav|252|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_067.wav|252|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_298.wav|252|They have played their part.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_251.wav|252|Perhaps it will happen again.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_121.wav|252|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_317.wav|252|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_009.wav|252|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_379.wav|252|That could be ready within another nine months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_186.wav|252|Art can challenge our value system.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_303.wav|252|Tomorrow will be my last.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_135.wav|252|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_245.wav|252|This is absolutely not true.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_073.wav|252|None has ever been found.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_028.wav|252|He does not even trust his own members.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_358.wav|252|Is there a waiting list?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_391.wav|252|I've kept him in touch with everything.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_114.wav|252|So they should be.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_322.wav|252|We are keen to see truth and justice.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_052.wav|252|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_264.wav|252|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_270.wav|252|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_046.wav|252|They seem too much of a sure thing.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_336.wav|252|Do you think we are a top nation?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_100.wav|252|The circumstances have changed since last year.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_385.wav|252|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_329.wav|252|The performance continues to improve.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_090.wav|252|There is no issue of national security involved here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_059.wav|252|Or so he thought.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_215.wav|252|Fine, said the press officer.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_023.wav|252|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_353.wav|252|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_165.wav|252|They have shown great character.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_171.wav|252|That apart, though, I feel good.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_347.wav|252|Those overseas offices were great.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_037.wav|252|Instead, we make the ground pay.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_201.wav|252|What was the matter for concern?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_084.wav|252|He has a real potential.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_366.wav|252|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_150.wav|252|Why change it?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_199.wav|252|And they were being paid?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_220.wav|252|There is no doubt there's room for us.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_016.wav|252|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_293.wav|252|He is a good signing for Rangers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_400.wav|252|We will miss him against Celtic.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_308.wav|252|We have achieved that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_078.wav|252|So is that it, then?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_287.wav|252|They were seriously after him.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_002.wav|252|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_234.wav|252|We know the problems.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_144.wav|252|I'd always wanted to act.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_372.wav|252|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_054.wav|252|Schools will not want change.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_262.wav|252|So we kept them waiting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_112.wav|252|There was no reason.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_324.wav|252|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_168.wav|252|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_397.wav|252|He has worked hard over the years.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_218.wav|252|Her experience is certainly limited.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_383.wav|252|I got dropped for that game.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_330.wav|252|We want immediate action.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_106.wav|252|And so it went on.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_276.wav|252|All films open tomorrow
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_040.wav|252|He too started on the subs seats.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_089.wav|252|It was exactly four months away.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_194.wav|252|A child is not a product.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_127.wav|252|It seemed like four hours.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_311.wav|252|Many events are down on numbers.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_061.wav|252|The fifth was found later.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_243.wav|252|I did let myself down a bit.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_075.wav|252|Their time has gone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_305.wav|252|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_133.wav|252|Eight others have followed.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_149.wav|252|Was it the wife?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_239.wav|252|The board do not own the company.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_005.wav|252|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_233.wav|252|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_143.wav|252|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_375.wav|252|If you believe in the blue and white.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_139.wav|252|It should have its own network.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_280.wav|252|They bought the property four years ago.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_294.wav|252|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_407.wav|252|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_361.wav|252|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_157.wav|252|He said some things which were better left alone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_227.wav|252|Her death is a huge blow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_011.wav|252|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_083.wav|252|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_176.wav|252|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_389.wav|252|The women are victims here.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_340.wav|252|If we get the wrong candidate.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_030.wav|252|Schools do not create that.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_206.wav|252|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_212.wav|252|It plans to return to this field.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_024.wav|252|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_354.wav|252|Any increase always has some effect.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_162.wav|252|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_118.wav|252|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_268.wav|252|But the next day she paid for it.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_097.wav|252|We are already seeing some positive results.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_378.wav|252|The referee faces a massive job.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_187.wav|252|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_008.wav|252|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_244.wav|252|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_072.wav|252|That is not possible.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_302.wav|252|So does every industry.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_134.wav|252|We're currently looking at the level of support.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_120.wav|252|No country has a similar training programme.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_316.wav|252|Motherwell took them from half chances.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_066.wav|252|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_299.wav|252|He followed the Italian route.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_250.wav|252|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_193.wav|252|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_337.wav|252|Is our children learning?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_101.wav|252|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_271.wav|252|This was the perfect setting.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_047.wav|252|That's what set him apart.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_384.wav|252|No real attempt was made to get orders.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_359.wav|252|Do they think anyone else wants them?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_390.wav|252|I'm not sure that's right.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_029.wav|252|Do not give your details to anyone.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_053.wav|252|By all accounts he was delighted.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_265.wav|252|The proposal was rejected.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_115.wav|252|No progress has been made.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_323.wav|252|We have clearly become well established.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_036.wav|252|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_200.wav|252|was everything done to save people?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_170.wav|252|The second failed completely.

../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_286.wav|252|The future might well be green after all.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_309.wav|252|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_145.wav|252|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_373.wav|252|This is far too high.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_003.wav|252|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_235.wav|252|Britain will be little affected.

../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_277.wav|252|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.

../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_088.wav|252|That remains the same.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_331.wav|252|Our relationship has been very good.

../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_304.wav|252|But there's also a love for the songs.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_132.wav|252|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.

../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_094.wav|252|The car driver died.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_339.wav|252|Because I think it's there.
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_080.wav|252|What do we do?
../dataset/VTCK/wav/p252/p252_033.wav|252|Just look at his fashion sense.
